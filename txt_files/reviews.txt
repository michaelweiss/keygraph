I initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.Fortunately, I had friends who owned each, so I ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).It's been a week and I am loving my paperwhite, no regrets! The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (In any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).Also glad that I went for the international shipping option with Amazon. Extra expense, but delivery was on time, with tracking, and I didnt need to worry about customs, which I may have if I used a third party shipping service.
Allow me to preface this with a little history. I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.
I am enjoying it so far. Great for reading. Had the original Fire since 2012. The Fire used to make my eyes hurt if I read too long. Haven't experienced that with the Paperwhite yet.
I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more
I have to say upfront - I don't like coroporate, hermetically closed stuff like anything by Apple or in this case, Amazon. I like having devices on which I can put anything I want and use it. But...I was a fairly happy user of a Nook Touch for several years, but couldn't use all its functionalities since I live in Serbia. Then I lost the Nook and since no other devices can actually be fully used in Serbia (buying books with them, using their online capabilities) except the Kindle, and since no one except Amazon ships to Serbia, and since I've actually been a happy Amazon customer since 2005 over friends' accounts and since 2007 through my own, and since the Kindle definitely has the best technology - why not buy itSo I did. What I read in many reviews about the screen/light of the Paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine. The light disperses just fine, except a few black blotches (maybe you can see it in the picture) at the bottom of the screen, which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can't really be avoided. As you can see in the picture without the light - there are no blotches with light out.The Paperwhite's screen is just marvelous at 300 ppi, the touchscreen works just fine, the store works here in Serbia, and in these two days I've been using it, I'm a happy guy.I had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like Amazon books, but that's fine. That's the one thing I'd like to see Amazon do in some future upgrades: make the Kindle treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly, with sharing funcion (quotes and Goodreads) enabled and so on.The size is perfect, it sits very well in the hand, the light doesn't hurt the eyes in the dark (like the light on a tab does)... the packaging was fine, no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life.So far, I can only recommend it.
My previous kindle was a DX, this is my second kindle in years. Love the form factor and all but I do miss the physical buttons for page turning. There is a glitch in the software though. I use the English interface but occasionally I would like to translate words into traditional Chinese. However, it seems that the traditional Chinese characters cannot display correctly and become small boxes. The simplified Chinese characters can be displayed correctly though.

Just got mine right now. Looks the same as the previous generation except for the Kindle logo (it's black this time), feels a little heavier, the screen is a little warmer toned than the previous one, BUT the resolution is SO MUCH BETTER! The 300 ppi are definitely obvious and the new font is worth the money.Totally recommend it for a book lover!I'll give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am used to a cooler screen, but I'm sure I'll get used to this one soon too :)

As reviewed by the wife This is the perfect thing for a new mommy who loves to read books! As soon as I had my baby girl, I had to stop reading my novels because I had to give the baby my full attention. But how much time do I spend laying in bed, on my side, with the baby while she feeds Especially prior to 4 months when feeding took as long as 45 minutes! Not to mention cluster feeds during growth spurts! A book was out of the question because it's sooo tiring to hold up in side-lying-breastfeeding-position. My new Kindle was the solution! It's light, easy to disinfect (I use baby wipes on the case whenever I feel like it's not clean enough to go on the bed with the baby) and you don't need to keep a finger in the middle of the pages to keep it from closing - you know what I mean!And for some reason it's much easier to go through a book with a Kindle compared to an actual book. I never thought I'd be converted into the Kindle culture but here we are!
My new Kindle Paperwhite came from the USA to a small town in Sweden in just five days. Payment of tax and customs handled by Amazon. Had not the UPS been so square (they think everyone sits at home all day) I had received it a day earlier.I am very pleased with the e-reader, easy on the eyes, and comfortable to hold in one hand. Even if I buy many books from Amazon I also want to read books in the ePub format. A positive surprise was how easy it is to convert ePub format to Amazon's own format. I use the program Calibre and then I just send the book as an attachment in an e-mail to my Kindle. Quick and easy!
I am enjoying it so far. Great for reading. Had the original Fire since 2012. The Fire used to make my eyes hurt if I read too long. Haven't experienced that with the Paperwhite yet.
Had older model, that you could text to speech, this one hasn't. Liked the smaller size, but having to buy a different cover! Still getting used to shelf quite different from my 4 year old model.Paper white is nice reading.
This is a review of the Kindle Paperwhite launched July 2015. Essentially. the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device. This review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you.Before I start, Ive noticed several complains about Kindle not supporting the ePub format used by Canadian public libraries. Dont be put off, theres a solution in the Frequently Asked Questions section below.This review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits. If youre in a hurry Ive included a summary at the start, and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the end.Summary - What can you do with it-----------------------------------------* Read a book. It can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday.* Buy a book. You can browse the Amazon kindle store, and buy books over a WIFI connection* Borrow a book. Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60,000 books (if you have Amazon Prime Membership)* Share your books. Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family* Highlight a section. Using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines. If several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated.* Record a bookmark. To come back to it later* Read a book on your Kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position* Look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder* Track a characters appearance throughout a book using the X Ray feature.* Read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks* Share you books (Multiple Kindles on the same account, or family sharing)* Access every book you've ever owned on the cloud - available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3G..What Devices are available--------------------------------As of July 2015, Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale:-1. Kindle 6 (around CDN 79)2. Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation (212 dpi - launched October 2013) - around CDN 1292. New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen (300 dpi - launched July 2015) - around CDN 139-2093. Kindle Voyger - around US 219-289 (Doesnt seem to be on sale in Amazon Canada)4. Kindle Fire - 6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around CDN 300-400So you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options. Which to buy Here's a quick summary in order of cost.*** The entry level Kindle ***An entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks.A terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender. For the technically minded, it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an E-ink display. Essentially this means it's (a) Black and White (b) Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) Requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours.*** New Kindle Paperwhite ***Launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range Voyage. The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original Paperwhite to 6 weeks - but still a very long time.Compared to the existing (2013) Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before, and a new Bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screen.If you have an existing Paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading. However, if you own a prior device, youll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance.*** The Voyage ***Far more expensive that Paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter. It has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges. The back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new Page Press buttons on the side to turn the pages. When the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch). It has 4Gb of storage (same as the Paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge.Although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the Paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions. This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright. In addition, youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness. To compensate, the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly. A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device.*** Kindle Fire Tablet Computer ***The Kindle Fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range. Similar to the Apple iPad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks. Although you can read books on a Fire using the Amazon Kindle App, youll find the Kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book. Youll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading eMails, the Kindle is a dedicated book reader device.Unlike a Kindle, the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep. The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it wont for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark.Finally, unlike the rest of the Kindle range, the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use, its less useful on holiday. The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight.What other options do I have----------------------------------Having decided upon the model (Kindle, Paperwhite, Voyage or Fire), the next decision is around:-* Special Offers - ie. adverts* 3G or WIFI connectionPersonally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle. They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting.The 3G option is a more difficult question. This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books over-the-air instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot. Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable, but its a personal choice. Of course if you wont have WIFI at home, then youll need the 3G option.One point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a Personal Hotspot or local WIFI signal that your Kindle (or indeed any other WIFI device) can connect to. Got to Settings Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while youre out and about.Conclusion-------------If you love books but your on a budget, the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option. Youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but youll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the Papwerwhite.The Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen. Finally, theres the top of the range Voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness.If youre in the market for a Tablet Computer then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering, but youll get a better book reading experience on the Kindle. Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2. I was skeptical at first, but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus.Frequently Asked Questions---------------------------------Q: What file format will a Kindle readA: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively in addition to HTML, DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversionQ: What It doesnt support EPUB formatA: No - but you can convert your EPUB books using a freely available program called Calibre. Simple search for You Tube um0teoAR6zw and youll see a video explaining how to do this. Simples.Q: If I lose my Kindle, do I lose my books as wellA: No. All books are available on your Amazon account to download on a new device.Q: Can I save my place in the bookA: Yes. It will automatically save your place, and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position.Q: I often need reading glasses - can I adjust the font sizeA: Yes. Theres a range of fonts, and sizes to suit all tastesQ: Can I share books with my partner or childrenA: Yes. You can now share your books using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire familyQ. Can I use a Kindle to read in bedA. Yes. But only on the Paperwhite and Voyage models. Its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light. For the base Kindle model youll need the light onQ. Are there any free books availableA. Yes! Over 40,000 classic titles are available for free (out of copyright), and they can be legally downloaded. If you have a Amazon Prime membership you can also borrow a book from the Kindle Owners Library which includes around 60,000 books.Q: How long does the battery lastA: Depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day. Ive certainly found Ive gone for weeks without charging the deviceQ: How long does it take to chargeA: From absolutely flat, around 4 hoursQ: How many books will the Kindle holdA: Literally thousands. You can also download every book youve ever owned from your Amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited.Q: Do I need anything elseA: Youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesnt come with a charger (but the Fire does). Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it. Some people also buy a cover, but I think this is not really needed. It adds to the weight, and is not really needed. It will protect your Kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag.
I love my kindle! I got one for my fiance on his birthday, he loved it!!!!!!! so I decided to get one for myself as well and I am glad I did. It is very easy to read books in it. I LOVE the dictionary on this little device. Normally I just skip a word I don't know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindle, I just press and hold my finger on the word I don't know and translation pops up! so essentially, the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips! )If you love to read books, I highly recommend kindle.However, if you only read Manga or Comic books, if you are a fan of buying how to draw, how to sew books I do not recommend kindle for you. It is not easy to navigate trough pictures and slides.So if you are a fan of reading novels just buy it now!If you are a manga fan, just buy your manga books from bookstores.
Vraiment bon petit appareil , lger et facile d emploiJ ai hte de m en servir sur les plages cet hiverBelle bibliothque de livres disponiblesBon achat en bref
Exactly what it is supposed to be. Works great and I love the built-in light. Perfect reader, and very quick delivery.
Trs heureux que les livres soient sur Icloud. Aprs m'tre fait voler, c'est bien de pouvoir retrouver tous mes livres avec toutes les notes que j'avais prises.
Only 4 stars because I found it very confusing at first. I had a Kindle before found it very easy to find what I needed to do. The user guide didn't really answer my questions, but I persisted am getting used to it. I really love the backlit screen no buttons to push to change pages. At first I wasn't sure about the smaller screen, but didn't take long to get over that. I'm sure I'm just a creature of habit not very techy. All in all, the Kindle Paperwhite is great.
Almost like reading a real book. Don't is crisp, sharp and easy to read. I've held out from buying a reader for years because I could never quite get past the fact it wasn't a book. With this new kindle I don't even notice, I am immediately immersed. Wildly better than I expected.
I already had an original Kindle Paperwhite and loved it. Buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but I am so pleased I made this move. I love the new font and the clarity of the screen. I love that the Kindle comes to life when I open the cover (I bought a new cover with the magnetic clasp). While there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the Kindle there are enough changes and improvements for me to feel I have made a great purchase which I am happy with. I also have a bunch of books from my Amazon.co.uk site which I access on my 'old' Kindle (I couldn't work out how, if at all, I can move books from one Amazon jurisdiction to another) so this has proved a good purchase all round.
Received my new kindle in perfect condition and I am very happy it is faster and a clearer it has a. bigger had drive at a good price and a fast delivery that you can count on you can not go wrongThank you
The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more
I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to. I don't own a Nook. I don't own an iPad (and, in any case, that's comparing apples to oranges).

The e-ink display is amazing.2. Using the 5-way controller is simple and effective.3. Page turn speeds are faster than I thought they would be.4. It's lightweight, even with the attached cover (I have an Amazon cover with a built-in light)5. Page-turning buttons are quiet and well-placed.6. Recharge time is fast.7.

UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more

I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed.

I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to. I don't own a Nook. I don't own an iPad (and, in any case, that's comparing apples to oranges).

UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more

The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more

I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.br /br /Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.br /br /One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more
I use to hate to read but now that I have my Kindle and I can change the size of the font so this old lady can see the words better I love to read.
All of them quit working. There's absolutely no way to revive them once that battery loses power If NOT charged immediately, if even just a few weeks go by, NO HOPE of ever using your Kindle again. A major flaw
I recently ordered my 8th Kindle. It was to replace my 7th Kindle which I unknowingly crushed. I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. For me, newer is just more frustrating. However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem. The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly. I was on the phone for 4 minutes.
Great. Love it.
I researched the purchase of a Kindle for a long time. I couldn't decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e-reader. Boy am I glad I made this purchase. The downside to Amazon's online selling of Kindle 3 is that the customers don't get to see it in person. It is much better in person. This may sound stupid, but when I got my new Kindle, I thought there was a stuck-on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit's buttons, etc. I actually tried to peel it off. Doh! The e-ink on this unit is THAT good. I didn't realize that I was staring at the actual display. I also didn't realize that no power is required until the display changes. (thus the great battery life) I do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. The new Kindle has been a godsend. Now, I can decide the size of type I need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. The weight and ergonomics are very good. For someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. To me, it is easier to read than print books. The ease of navigation is great as is the speed. The battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. It easily connected to our home Wi-Fi, which by design does not broadcast an SSID. It downloads books so fast that I almost thought they were not completely received. I did not buy the 3G version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where I live. If you are not constantly traveling, I don't see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice. For those who have no Wi-Fi at home, remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via USB.Read more
This thing has captured my wife's heart. She reads every where, all the time. Vacation, on the way to church, At bedtime and far beyond. Books are so easy to get from the kindle itself It fits in her purse, I have to repeat everything , I always get, right after this chapter . Do not buy this for someone you want share LIFE with.
I got my Kindle a few years ago and barely used it. Recently I discovered it again and have been using it daily, always in a hard protective case as it has been from day 1. Yesterday I opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked, seemingly for no apparent reason (no extreme temperatures, dropping, pressure, etc.). A quick Google search revealed this is a common problem, especially for my model, which made me think Amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw. Not a chance though. Despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative I spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product. Not sure it is worth the investment again - thinking it is better to stick to reading on my iPad, which is equipped with indestructible Gorilla Glass. Bottom line: do not buy a Kindle if you want a lasting product
It was excellent for me in one moment when I was able to use it onboard cruise ship while ship was in international water with it's own 3G or EDGE cellphone network. Once they stop this way of using around 5 months ago, now I can use it only when I am in the states.
Bought for my husband for Christmas and I have to admit that I use it much more than he does, I love this product even though it has been updated with newer versions. I like to have something with just books. Easy to use, screen is easy to read, battery life long. I use it at the beach and for travel. Nice to have
It simply works even after 3.5 years of constant use. The battery is OK. Display looks the same. System is stable and reasonably responsive.
I would highly recommend them to everyone. Got it when I was told that I would get it. Very happy.

Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more
I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!

I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more

Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more
An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysJuly 30, 2014Hi Dallas, thank you for sharing your feedback. We wanted to let you know that we made it easier to find your favorite Prime content with the click of your remote. You can now browse many more Prime-only categories, including Top Prime TV, Top Prime Movies, Prime TV for Kids, Prime Movies for Kids, Prime TV by Genre, and Prime Movies by Genre.
I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!

I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading).
I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa.
I love everything about this case except for how it fits on the Echo Dot. I was expecting a snug fit however, it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it (and the power cable is disconnected), the dot will fall out of the case.
Major fan, didn't buy this because of protection, bought it cause it will blend in to my decor. It is not a skin, so it's not skin tight. Yes it's loose but how often will you grab it and move it. Me maybe once every year.
Like a previous reviewer mentioned it is fabric over hard plastic it is not a snug or tight fit. Good quality though.
Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen. There has to be something I can do. I looked and search and what I found is the Fabric Case for Alexa. This is it! A support she will be happy to wear. No more accidental popping out, no more shifting and readjusting, she is finally safe.
Changes the whole look of the Echo ... after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather. But blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk! The texture is also really nice feel and look to it!
A great looking cover for the Echo Dot. It gives the Dot a softer and more elegant look. I feel that it is a little pricy for what you get but I do not regret my decision to buy this case.
This is perfect. A lot of people were commenting that the case falls off and it's not portable. That's not the intended use of the case. It is strictly for decorative use. It look great and comes in several color options. Would definitely purchase again.

I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more
Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.) Doesn't adversely affect sound qualityOverall: I do feel 20 for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap, I very happy with it.. I didn't buy my tap to sit still at home..Read more
Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!
Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more
Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more
After 15 months, my 500+ tablet is no longer useable. It is stuck on the boot screen. I invested a lot of into Amazon movies and books. This stinks.
Cons:1. Built on Android does not mean you can have Google Play Apps. This is an unfortunate inconvenience, as there are some Google Apps that are just better than their Amazon App counterparts, and a few that I can not find within the Amazon Apps. If you want a fully functional tablet, then buy a tablet and download the free kindle app. If you want to pay more for something that does less, then the kindle is for you. This was a gift, so I will keep it, and continue to use my phone for the rest of my Apps that are not available on the kindle.2. Camera is less than perfect. Limited settings available. Again, I will use my phone for pics, the same scene with my phone showed the flames, with a small amount of glare. (Husband is a firefighter, so I take a lot of pictures of their exercises for their training.) An old Casio Exilim C721 phone with 5MP camera still takes better pictures at night.3. Kindle unlimited... I can not find anything worthy of paying a subscription price every month for. The Authors I want to read are not included.4. Amazon Prime... See 3, They doubled the price, and to me I just don't see anything there worthy of the cost, including Amazon instant video, no shows that I watch are included. Another family member did the 30 day trial, and was quite disappointed when his content disappeared after the trial.5. Youtube videos work ok, sometimes choppy, could be my connection or the device (computer playback worked fine when I had the time to test simutaneously). Other online video from various sources would not play in Silk Browser, refer to 1 Chrome Browser not available to download.6. Office Suite... I can not figure out how to unlock documents. I can view them, but I can not edit them.Somewhere in the middle:1.Read more

Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity.

Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more

Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more

I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading).
I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa.
I love everything about this case except for how it fits on the Echo Dot. I was expecting a snug fit however, it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it (and the power cable is disconnected), the dot will fall out of the case.
Major fan, didn't buy this because of protection, bought it cause it will blend in to my decor. It is not a skin, so it's not skin tight. Yes it's loose but how often will you grab it and move it. Me maybe once every year.
Like a previous reviewer mentioned it is fabric over hard plastic it is not a snug or tight fit. Good quality though.
Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen. There has to be something I can do. I looked and search and what I found is the Fabric Case for Alexa. This is it! A support she will be happy to wear. No more accidental popping out, no more shifting and readjusting, she is finally safe.
Changes the whole look of the Echo ... after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather. But blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk! The texture is also really nice feel and look to it!
A great looking cover for the Echo Dot. It gives the Dot a softer and more elegant look. I feel that it is a little pricy for what you get but I do not regret my decision to buy this case.
This is perfect. A lot of people were commenting that the case falls off and it's not portable. That's not the intended use of the case. It is strictly for decorative use. It look great and comes in several color options. Would definitely purchase again.

I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more
Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.) Doesn't adversely affect sound qualityOverall: I do feel 20 for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap, I very happy with it.. I didn't buy my tap to sit still at home..Read more
Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!
I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading).
I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa.
I love everything about this case except for how it fits on the Echo Dot. I was expecting a snug fit however, it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it (and the power cable is disconnected), the dot will fall out of the case.
Major fan, didn't buy this because of protection, bought it cause it will blend in to my decor. It is not a skin, so it's not skin tight. Yes it's loose but how often will you grab it and move it. Me maybe once every year.
Like a previous reviewer mentioned it is fabric over hard plastic it is not a snug or tight fit. Good quality though.
Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen. There has to be something I can do. I looked and search and what I found is the Fabric Case for Alexa. This is it! A support she will be happy to wear. No more accidental popping out, no more shifting and readjusting, she is finally safe.
Changes the whole look of the Echo ... after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather. But blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk! The texture is also really nice feel and look to it!
A great looking cover for the Echo Dot. It gives the Dot a softer and more elegant look. I feel that it is a little pricy for what you get but I do not regret my decision to buy this case.
This is a great controller for our Fire TV, I purchased 2 of them, with two problems but let me first talk about the good. The controller works well for most of the games we play on the Fire TV. It has a long range compared to other controllers Ive tried (solid at 30 feet) and uses WiFi Direct instead of Bluetooth. The feel of it is decent (not too rubbery) and none of the buttons, D-Pad, or sticks have stuck or given us a problem. The microphone on it works as good or better than the one on the Fire TV remote.Now on to the problems. Its such an issue that Im not just putting it in the cons section but am going to tell you a bit about it. The worst problem is the battery life! In fact, its such a huge problem that Im taking off 2 stars because of it. This controller eats batteries like nobodys business. I have tried regular AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), expensive AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), and rechargeable AA batteries (Ive tried Energizer, Apple, AmazonBasics). The controller doesnt drain the batteries completely, nope. That I would understand. Instead, the controller stops working after only a 40 drain. I kid you not. Every set of batteries I have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still 60 battery life left. I have tested each set, before and after, using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter.The second problem may not be the controller itself, it may be the Fire TV, but its affecting the controller. The controller randomly disconnects. Not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying. I have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote. Im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update.Read more
Without an on / off button, I have found that the controller comes on (the light comes on showing it's connected to the FireTV) even when not in use. I am assuming this is why the batteries were draining so quick. Now, I put the remote into a 2nd room when I am not using it and the batteries last a normal lifespan. The light never turns on know when the remote is in the other room.
Not that Amazon needs another 5 star review for this remote, but damn. This is a great remote. We don't have and never will have a game console in my house. My 4 year old and I have a blast playing Crossy Road and Shark Evolution on our big screen TV with this remote. Super great. Glad I bought it.
We are HUGE fans of the Amazon Fire Stick and my son realllly wants to play the games with the remote. A little pricey in my opinion. Works great though and I know I can return if it breaks!
Ok i've been in the technology field for close to 20 years and a gamer since the 80's so i know a little something about controllers. This really is an awesome controller with a great feel to it. It doesnt feel cheap in any way, and works perfect. It also has voice search button which works great and it has volume control via the shoulder buttons when headphones are plugged in. Ive read a few reviews about bad battery life and i havent found it an issue on mine. I bought it in late december and the batteries are due to be changed now in late april. I would like to see rechargable batteries built it instead but maybe in the future.
I have the original Nvidia Shield TV (not the latest 2017 version) and as such, I also have the older/bulkier controller that it came with. While it works alright, I was never that happy with it just because it's so large and clunky (I have smaller hands) and never got all that comfortable with it. So, I went searching for a replacement controller to use with it...Along came the 2017 Shield TV and a newly revamped controller. Looks nice, got good reviews, but at this time, almost impossible to find one new or used for under 50 which is a bit more than I wanted to pay for a controller.I found the Amazon Fire TV controller searching around and wondered if it would work with the Shield. Turns out that the AFT controller is NOT bluetooth, but rather, Wi-Fi direct. Did a little more research and a few random searches led me to believe that you could indeed use this controller with a Shield TV.Since it's not bluetooth, trying to pair this controller with the Shield (or any other bluetooth device) is impossible. But, at the suggestion of someone on an Nvidia forum, if you go into the Shield's settings and go to the add Shield Accessory setting, while holding the home button on the AFT controller, after a few moments, indeed, it does connect and it does work. It doesn't show up as a Shield accessory (since technically, it's not) so it's kinda weird that way. Nowhere will you see in the Shield's settings or options that the controller is even connected.After connecting or pairing the AFT controller with my Shield I noticed that I lost all sound and audio. The AFT controller microphone works, but it basically caused me to lose all sound on my Shield. Needless to say that bummed me out.Read more
This is my second one and it is great! It can be used as a remote also. It was easy to pair with my Fire TV. I received my first one when I purchased the Gaming Edition of Fire TV and I liked it so much that I bought a second one for my son. He is a gamer and he was very happy with it.I would recommend this product for anyone who is a gamer. There are many more games available for the Fire TV and they play flawlessly on the Fire TV
I purchased the original Kindle Fire in 2011 and the second generation Kindle Fire in 2012. I gave my original one to my grandson and he is still using it for apps and reading. I liked both of them and I have to tell you that they have held up very well. One is over 3 years old and the other is 2 years old and I have not had any issues with them. Since I have not upgraded in 2 years I thought I would get a new one with a larger memory and a faster CPU and a higher resolution display. There are many improvements beyond even those features.I have to tell you that overall I am impressed with this new one. I didn't feel the need to purchase a Kindle Fire every year and when I purchased the next one I wanted it to be a definite upgrade step to what I had. I stayed with the 7 inch size as I like to portability and weight for long term reading. I alternate between the Kindle Paperwhite for reading in the daytime and at night sometimes and I use the Kindle Fire for reading in the evening and at night plus browsing the internet and getting email. This new Kindle Fire HD 2014 version is very fast and easy to use. Setting it up for the internet and downloading my apps and books was a breeze. I like the fact that the larger memory allows me to carry more apps and books. The higher resolution of the screen is helpful in reading books as the text is clearer and easier on my eyes than the older Kindle Fires we own. The screen is better for playing apps and watching videos and movies and it is worth the upgrade from the older Kindle Fires.I like that this version has both a front and rear facing camera. I use the camera a lot on all of my tablets and I own many Apple iPads, Apple iPhone and Android tablets.Read more
The Fire HD 7 is a great entry-level Fire Tablet that includes a 7 1200x800 216 ppi pixel density display. Pixel density wise, this is the lowest off all the Fire Tablets but is still decent enough where you're going to get a nice picture on the display. It's by no means an iPad killer or Galaxy Tab killer and you really shouldn't purchase it for that purpose. This particular model is really tailored to reading Kindle books, streaming video, browsing the web, checking email, and so forth. Bottom line, It's a great deal at 139. I'm going to compare the features of the HD 7 with the features of the other Fire Tablets to help you make an informed decision on which model to go with:*** DISPLAY ***The display is a 7 1200x800 resolution display with a 216 ppi pixel density which is not great, but not horrible either. It is the lowest pixel density of all the Fire Tablets with the Fire HD 6 coming in at 252 ppi, the Fire HDX coming in at 323 ppi, and the Fire HDX 8.9 coming in at 339 ppi. The human eye really can't distinguish individual pixels beyond a density of about 300 ppi so you're not going to be getting a noticeably pixelated display by any means. All in all, this is a nice display.*** PROCESSOR, GPU, AND ON-BOARD STORAGE ***The Fire HD 7 comes with a respectable 1.5 GHz quad-core processor with enough power to run almost all of your content with ease, including smooth video playback. It comes with a mediocre 1 GB of RAM which really is not sufficient in my opinion but it is what it is. THis is not an iPad or Galaxy Tab killer by any means, but it gives you just enough power to use the essential Amazon services you need.The HD 7 is substantially less powerful than the Snapdragon 2.2 GHz and 2.Read more
oh my effing word. this has better sound than my hp laptop. with one of the standing cases, you can turn it into a kitchen tv by laying the flap on the bottom shelf of a cabinet above your counter, and then placing a can of something on the flap to make sure it stays there. gently close the cabinet door, and it stays there hanging down so you can watch something while you prepare dinner. the standing cases work, but I don't want my kindle on the counter top near any possibly splashing liquids, so I started doing the hanging thing. I say screw normality and lets do things a different way...
I'm writing this review with the benefit of being an experienced Kindle Fire user vs. someone brand new to the Kindle family. In summary, for 139 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and last year's Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend this regular Fire HD vs. a more expensive version. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire to last year's Fire HD but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the Fire, setup took a while: despite being a brand new product, the Fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates. You just need to be patient while it downloads and installs.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has a great screen display and looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching an episode of The Lost Ship. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model.Read more

This integrated perfectly with our fire tv stick, and was a great surprise for the gamers in the family. It works great with the fire stick, and does not negate the other remote, giving us two remote options. It even has a headphone jack, making it so my husband can watch tv shows with bad language while the kids are in the room. This is a great addition.
The connection drop's out on this unit pretty bad. I can hardly get thru a game and it will disconnect.
Great add-on if you own a amazon fire stick and like to play games. works well and I would definite buy it again.
Not that Amazon needs another 5 star review for this remote, but damn. This is a great remote. We don't have and never will have a game console in my house. My 4 year old and I have a blast playing Crossy Road and Shark Evolution on our big screen TV with this remote. Super great. Glad I bought it.
Nice controller
I've had this for about 8 months now. And in those 8 months I've switched back and forth from this remote, and the tiny remote it came with. I lost the tiny remote behind my bed 2 months ago and since I'm lazy, it's still down there. So I've had to rely on the game controller for everything (sad face).And that's not a good thing.....battery life is laughable. This controller is never farther than 7 feet from the box and yet, 9/10 I ALWAYS GET THE ANNOYING LOADING/CONNECTING DOTS.This cost 60. And for that amount of money, It should be CONNECTING to a box that's 7 FEET AWAY.damn you amazon, I still love you tho.
I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more
Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.) Doesn't adversely affect sound qualityOverall: I do feel 20 for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap, I very happy with it.. I didn't buy my tap to sit still at home..Read more
Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device.

And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that.

As has been the case for years, Amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the Kindle. This one is no exception. If you've used a Kindle in the past, you're not going to notice much of a change with this one, but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth, I'll briefly go over them:*** SCREEN ***The new Kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray/off-white paper looking background. It's certainly not bright white, but it's also not LCD looking (dark gray.) It does NOT have buttons for page-turning as the older generations do. If you simply must have the page-turning buttons, please search for the older Kindles that offer that. One last thing regarding the screen: this is not a Kindle PaperWhite or Voyage where you have a back-lit screen... this has an unlit, off-white Kindle screen. I will say, the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than I've seen with previous generation Kindles and I believe that's because Amazon is using E-Ink's new Carta displays instead of the previously used Pearl displays. I love that and have been waiting for years for E-Ink, the Taiwan based company that makes the Kindle screens for Amazon, to improve them. It looks like they're finally getting it!The new Kindle's screen resolution is 167 ppi which is slightly lower than the Kindle PaperWhite which is 212 ppi, and substantially lower than the Kindle Voyage which boasts an impressive 300 ppi (individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye.) Price-wise though, the base model PaperWhite runs 99 at the time of this review, and the Voyage base model runs 199 so you can see, the more you pay, the better the resolution and features. 167 ppi is fine though...Read more
I've had this Kindle for a while now. Many of the reviews say it all so I don't think I could add much. But I feel like I need to speak on behalf of this Kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought. If this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it. So I have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us allDo you have any clue what you bought Let's all say it out loud: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!!!! It is an entry level model with no light. Amazon has always sold non lighted Kindles, and I still have many of them. They are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. Can you read a real book in the dark Of course not. So these non lighted Kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. It is ridiculous to buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. Read the product descriptions. This Kindle has no light, the Paperwhite and Voyage do.Scream all to the heavens: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!!!! To buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old Kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane. Could you not see when you clicked on BUY that this Kindle had no page turning buttons. Sometimes I think there are two kinds of Kindle owners: those who want page turning buttons and those who don't mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page. If you can tell by my sarcasm, I belong to the latter bunch.Then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is, are unable to sign on, and blame it on the Kindle. BAM! another 1 star review.Read more
I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at 79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because 119 to 400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at 79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles. It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter. That's really annoying. Interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of Amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for 15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or 20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard, the previous version of Kindle, and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark.Read more
I've had this Kindle for a while now. Many of the reviews say it all so I don't think I could add much. But I feel like I need to speak on behalf of this Kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought. If this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it. So I have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us allDo you have any clue what you bought Let's all say it out loud: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!!!! It is an entry level model with no light. Amazon has always sold non lighted Kindles, and I still have many of them. They are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. Can you read a real book in the dark Of course not. So these non lighted Kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. It is ridiculous to buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. Read the product descriptions.

As has been the case for years, Amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the Kindle. This one is no exception. If you've used a Kindle in the past, you're not going to notice much of a change with this one, but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth, I'll briefly go over them:*** SCREEN ***The new Kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray/off-white paper looking background. It's certainly not bright white, but it's also not LCD looking (dark gray.) It does NOT have buttons for page-turning as the older generations do. If you simply must have the page-turning buttons, please search for the older Kindles that offer that. One last thing regarding the screen: this is not a Kindle PaperWhite or Voyage where you have a back-lit screen... this has an unlit, off-white Kindle screen. I will say, the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than I've seen with previous generation Kindles and I believe that's because Amazon is using E-Ink's new Carta displays instead of the previously used Pearl displays. I love that and have been waiting for years for E-Ink, the Taiwan based company that makes the Kindle screens for Amazon, to improve them. It looks like they're finally getting it!The new Kindle's screen resolution is 167 ppi which is slightly lower than the Kindle PaperWhite which is 212 ppi, and substantially lower than the Kindle Voyage which boasts an impressive 300 ppi (individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye.) Price-wise though, the base model PaperWhite runs 99 at the time of this review, and the Voyage base model runs 199 so you can see, the more you pay, the better the resolution and features. 167 ppi is fine though...Read more

I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more
Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.) Doesn't adversely affect sound qualityOverall: I do feel 20 for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap, I very happy with it.. I didn't buy my tap to sit still at home..Read more
Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!
Let me guess: you love books, but you're not sure you want to get a kindle because you love the feel of books, rightI'm here to tell you that the kindle is the perfect balance of book and digital format.SHORT REVIEWYes, you should buy a kindle. Get the paperwhite with no ads. You're welcome.LONG REVIEWI love physical books too, I'm with you. But I know myself, and I know that once I forget to take the book I'm reading with me, that's it. I'll start another book and rarely finish the first. I also know if I try and read on my phone or iPad that I'll get distracted and start wondering about what's happening on the internet (Instagram's not gonna scroll ITSELF). Either way I'm not finishing the book.WHY KINDLEThe kindle takes the best of both worlds and mashes them together. The e ink display is honestly incredible. I wish iPhones had an e ink display. It really looks just like a printed page. So you get the experience of reading a physical paper book, but with the perks of being digital.Namely:- Share what book you're reading to Goodreads, Facebook, or twitter (so you can look SMORT)- Built in dictionary (so you can learn the proper spelling of the word SMORT)- Export your highlights as a PDFPlus, it'll also sync with the kindle app on your phone so you can squeeze in the final few pages of the chapter while you're in the bathroom (don't pretend you don't do that. You're either on your phone or you're reading the febreeze ingredients)READING IN BEDThe backlight looks great. It's a perfect size.Read more
Review updated September 17, 2015As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing this review from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the 2013, 2014 and new 2015 Paperwhite, the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9. This review is for the 2015 All-New Kindle Paperwhite. The attached picture shows the 2014 Kindle on the left and the new 2015 Kindle on the right. Here is the summary of my initial impressions of the 2015 model versus the 2014 model.I am somewhat disappointed in the 2015 version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model. The Paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation 2012 model to its second generation 2013 model, especially in the display and processor area. The 2013 model came with 2 GB storage, a wonderful display, a great battery and was the e-book workhorse. The second generation 2014 model changed by only increasing storage to 4 GB. The third generation 2015 model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: A Paperwhite device, a quick-start guide and a short USB cord. Amazon still does not supply a power adapter.SIZE: Its the same identical size as the older Paperwhites. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.3 to 7.2 ounces, a fraction of an ounce, most likely because of a smaller battery.The good news is that all cases that fit the other Paperwhites will fit the 2015 version!!DISPLAY: The resolution has been bumped up to 300 ppi, equivalent to the Voyage.Read more
If you're reading reviews of the new 3rd generation Paperwhite, you're likely considering buying one. If so, you're probably in one of these categories:* Never owned a Kindle e-ink reader* Own an older Kindle e-ink reader, but not a Paperwhite* Own a first or second generation PaperwhiteI'll save my opinion on whether the new Paperwhite 3 is worth buying until the end of my review. (But I will say this: They've taken a great product and made it even better.) First, here's a comparison of the new Paperwhite with the second generation Paperwhite (comparisons are for the wi-fi models):Second Generation Paperwhite (2013)-------------------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.3 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 212 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 6Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingAll-New Paperwhite (2015)------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.2 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 7Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingNote that the physical size is identical to the older Paperwhite, so covers and sleeves that worked with the older Paperwhites are still usable (thank you, Amazon). The most obvious difference is the screen resolution: 300 pixels per inch is a major jump from the 212 pixels per inch in the older Paperwhites.Read more

I previously owned an Asus infinity with 10 inch screen until it died on vacation and I grabbed the smaller 8 gb fire during the one day sale. I could not get used to the small screen or lack of storage so here I am with the new 10 inch fire. If you liked your fire 7 you will love this. The 32 gb is sufficient itself for downloading tons of books, music, and a couple of movies and games but when you pair that with the ability at last to use a memory card (and it's about time Amazon makes a version that can do this) the storage is enough for even most power users! Set up is a breeze just follow the onscreen instructions. Within minutes out of the box I was surfing the web, checking my email and posting on Facebook. After charging the battery to full I streamed a one hour tv show from Netflix and when I checked afterwards the battery was still at 95 percent. I am writing this review on it right now. If you have prime you can download a movie to watch later without needing your wifi which is a big plus for me as we are in storm season here so when the power goes out I can at least watch a movie.
I bought this tablet for its size, economical price point, and the ability to watch content offline. And it offers exactly that...but falls short on performance parameters. If you're price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet, large screen, and the ability to watch content offline, this is a great device to get. However, if you already have an earlier Kindle like the HDX 8.9 or even an earlier version of the Fire, I recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn't really be a worthwhile upgrade. I have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device.The- constant freezing of the device,- slow speed to load apps,- significant lags when switching apps that only become worse as you load more stuff on the tablet,- erratic wifi connection that drops often and the ensuing trouble to connect back to the same network, and- the frequent need to reboot the device,all factors made this a frustrating device to own . The HDX is far better in every aspect, heck even the original Fire 7 runs better than this device.The only good things about this device are the screen size and the MicroSD slot. So if you're only watching videos on this, and would like to have the option of watching content offline when you're traveling, this tablet would be just fine. Otherwise, the HDX is still a better option, or you could get the 7 or 8 Fire models. Those are priced cheaper and work better.Original review is below---For the price point and size alone, the Fire HD 10 would seem like a good deal. For its performance, however, it falls short of expectations. I would probably rate it a 3.5 overall. If it wasn't for the price, the rating would have been even lower.Read more
What a DEAL............ I got this great tablet for a great price on Prime Day..... but was a little concerned it would be too big..to handle. but I was wrong.First I I was very surprised.. by several things about the Fire 10 that made me SMILE:......1) even though it is large in size the weight is LIGHT so it is much easier to handle than expected ( esp since my fire HD 8.9 HEAVY unit )).......2.) it does several things I wasn't expecting.. One is it has SCREEN MIRRORING... that means you can see your tablets screen on you great BIG TV screen. if you choose for games or what ever. 3. ) Smooth and FAST .. due to the nice processor.......4. ) WHOO HOO.. Google Play store can be easily added without disrupting you Amazon experience ( look it up on youtube))( it took less than 4 minutes and it was Up and RUNNING ))....... 5.) I think the Screen is Beautiful............ ( cannot imagine what others are seeing but this screen looks Great to me) 6.) FINALLY they put the speakers in the FRONT so it is much easier to hear you shows or music etc 7.) I think this is My FAV............I put in a great big 125g sd card and I am loaded to download anything I choose... loads of Movie from the A Amazon Prime Movies,..................ALL of my audio books from Audible.................and a huge amt of my Kindle Books...........I am delighted....... and should get several years out of this tablet in its present format..........ESP. now that google PLAY STORE is on it .Happy Happy Happy......
This is my 4th Kindle Fire, I also have the first generation, an 8.9 HDX and the new 6. The first thing that impresses is how thin and light this new model is, despite being the largest Fire to date. I love the more narrow, widescreen design of the screen, perfect for watching videos and reading books in portrait mode. Anyway, before I get carried away gushing, Ill just list my pros and one or two cons, to make this easier to read and save time.PROS:Wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books.The stereo speakers sound incredible, even better than the previous HDX modelFor comic book readers comics purchased from Amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from Comixology. I was wondering when Amazon was going to incorporate this feature for their comics, finally!Battery life seems to be similar to my 8.9 HDX, but Im happy with that considering the larger screen and thinness of the device.Considerably faster response time across the board.Finally! We can add a micro SD card to expand storage capacity! Yay!The camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous FireCONS:Would have preferred a rubberized back and case. The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet also.Still deciding on the new software layout, maybe its because Im so familiar with the old Fire OS, but lets just say Im not blown away be the design so far.
I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading).
I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa.
I love everything about this case except for how it fits on the Echo Dot. I was expecting a snug fit however, it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it (and the power cable is disconnected), the dot will fall out of the case.
Major fan, didn't buy this because of protection, bought it cause it will blend in to my decor. It is not a skin, so it's not skin tight. Yes it's loose but how often will you grab it and move it. Me maybe once every year.
Like a previous reviewer mentioned it is fabric over hard plastic it is not a snug or tight fit. Good quality though.
Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen. There has to be something I can do. I looked and search and what I found is the Fabric Case for Alexa. This is it! A support she will be happy to wear. No more accidental popping out, no more shifting and readjusting, she is finally safe.
Changes the whole look of the Echo ... after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather. But blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk! The texture is also really nice feel and look to it!
A great looking cover for the Echo Dot. It gives the Dot a softer and more elegant look. I feel that it is a little pricy for what you get but I do not regret my decision to buy this case.
I purchased 3 of these Kindle kids edition tablets for my toddlers (ages 4,3,2 years old) And 1 non kids edition one for our older child for Easter. I was quite nervous that they'd break or the cases wouldn't be durable or that they wouldn't be able to use the apps they'd been using on my Samsung Tab S.After considering the price to purchase 3 of them and checking out the apps my husband and I were pretty sure we would purchase them. Then I came across the warranty. 2 year worry free guarantee! Are you kidding me I knew there had to be a catch, I couldn't find one and at that point we were convinced it would be a good investment.I ordered 3 (at the time pink and blue were our only color choices) So we have 1 pink and 2 blue. Which has caused a host of issues on the toddler level (identifying who's tablet is who's as you can imagine)They were easy to set up and create their own profiles and add apps to each of their tables . I love the unlimited freetime, they've had their tables for a few months now and can completely work them themselves and download the apps/movies/books that they want. I don't have to do it for them (with the exception of my 2 year old of course). I was able to link our Disney movies anywhere account with our Amazon account and now they can access all of our Disney digital movies on their tables! Which was a huge win for us! I do wish that Amazon could figure out a way for us to be able to link our Ultraviolet movies, it's a huge bummer that Amazon doesn't offer any app to make that possible. I also love that I can login to my Amazon account and send apps/movies etc to their tablets as I see fit, I can locate and page their tables when they are misplaced and remote lock them if I need to .Read more
As the Kids Edition is nothing more than a basic 50 7 Kindle Fire with some extras, this review is primarily concerned with the 50-worth of extras bundled with the Kids Edition. Primarily, the year of included Freetime.As for the guts of the tablet itself, it's fine. Not great, but certainly fine. It's not the fastest tablet. It isn't the most feature-rich tablet. It doesn't have the sharpest display. But it's only 50, so it deserves to be graded on a curve. For a 50 tablet, it's great.Now, grab a coffee, get comfortable, because I have some thoughts on Amazon's Freetime service for kids/parents:Price plus the year of Freetime were the selling points for me (the case and added warranty were nice bonuses). The problem is, Freetime, though fantastic in theory, isn't even half-baked. It's a lump of dough left on the counter to rise. And then whoever was supposed to put it in the oven got distracted and forgot about it. It's getting moldy, and it smells kind of funny.Freetime: great in theory, terrible in practice.Normally, when you buy a new tablet, it might have a little bloatware pre-installed, but you generally don't start with the offerings of the entire app store on your homescreen. You find and add the apps you want.The way you install/remove apps in Freetime is sort of backwards. It's subtractive. Every single title is served up on the home screen (and in the apps, books, videos screens). These aren't technically pre-installed, but to a young kid looking at a sea of icons, it looks like he has all of these wonderful titles at his disposal. Well, he does. But only sort of. He clicks Elmo's face, and the wheel starts spinning over the icon while it downloads.Read more
*Edit 12/23/15*It appears that the linked SD card below and the one made for Fire tablets are the same price now, although the Fire one still does not come with an adapter. Should have been that way from day one.*end editLet's get the cost/benefit of buying this versus the 50 model out of the way. For 100, you get:7 Kindle Fire without sponsored lockscreens 65Kid-proof case 202-year accident protection 161-year of Free Time Unlimited 36 minimumThat's a nice value! I've seen a few reviews where people are upset that it doesn't work without Wi-Fi, but I'm not sure what their expectations are. If you have previously download an app/game/video and it doesn't require internet access (some do, some don't), it works fine. As for performance, it's OK. Not great. It freezes every now and then and needs to be rebooted more often than I'd like to get it working again. This is frustrating to a 3-year-old, as you can imagine. Hard to complain too much given the price, but I was expecting it to be more stable.You will want to buy a micro SD card because the Fire OS takes up 5 of the 8 GB of on-board storage. This is where Amazon is doing something that is, shall we say, a little sketchy. When you customize your purchase, it allows you to select the SanDisk 32 GB SD Memory Card for All-New Fire Tablets for 19.99 (or more or less depending on the storage size), but gives you no other options. This SD card is by the looks of it the exact same as this one ...Read more
I previously owned an Asus infinity with 10 inch screen until it died on vacation and I grabbed the smaller 8 gb fire during the one day sale. I could not get used to the small screen or lack of storage so here I am with the new 10 inch fire. If you liked your fire 7 you will love this. The 32 gb is sufficient itself for downloading tons of books, music, and a couple of movies and games but when you pair that with the ability at last to use a memory card (and it's about time Amazon makes a version that can do this) the storage is enough for even most power users! Set up is a breeze just follow the onscreen instructions. Within minutes out of the box I was surfing the web, checking my email and posting on Facebook. After charging the battery to full I streamed a one hour tv show from Netflix and when I checked afterwards the battery was still at 95 percent. I am writing this review on it right now. If you have prime you can download a movie to watch later without needing your wifi which is a big plus for me as we are in storm season here so when the power goes out I can at least watch a movie.
I bought this tablet for its size, economical price point, and the ability to watch content offline. And it offers exactly that...but falls short on performance parameters. If you're price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet, large screen, and the ability to watch content offline, this is a great device to get. However, if you already have an earlier Kindle like the HDX 8.9 or even an earlier version of the Fire, I recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn't really be a worthwhile upgrade. I have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device.The- constant freezing of the device,- slow speed to load apps,- significant lags when switching apps that only become worse as you load more stuff on the tablet,- erratic wifi connection that drops often and the ensuing trouble to connect back to the same network, and- the frequent need to reboot the device,all factors made this a frustrating device to own . The HDX is far better in every aspect, heck even the original Fire 7 runs better than this device.The only good things about this device are the screen size and the MicroSD slot. So if you're only watching videos on this, and would like to have the option of watching content offline when you're traveling, this tablet would be just fine. Otherwise, the HDX is still a better option, or you could get the 7 or 8 Fire models. Those are priced cheaper and work better.Original review is below---For the price point and size alone, the Fire HD 10 would seem like a good deal. For its performance, however, it falls short of expectations. I would probably rate it a 3.5 overall. If it wasn't for the price, the rating would have been even lower.Read more
What a DEAL............ I got this great tablet for a great price on Prime Day..... but was a little concerned it would be too big..to handle. but I was wrong.First I I was very surprised.. by several things about the Fire 10 that made me SMILE:......1) even though it is large in size the weight is LIGHT so it is much easier to handle than expected ( esp since my fire HD 8.9 HEAVY unit )).......2.) it does several things I wasn't expecting.. One is it has SCREEN MIRRORING... that means you can see your tablets screen on you great BIG TV screen. if you choose for games or what ever. 3. ) Smooth and FAST .. due to the nice processor.......4. ) WHOO HOO.. Google Play store can be easily added without disrupting you Amazon experience ( look it up on youtube))( it took less than 4 minutes and it was Up and RUNNING ))....... 5.) I think the Screen is Beautiful............ ( cannot imagine what others are seeing but this screen looks Great to me) 6.) FINALLY they put the speakers in the FRONT so it is much easier to hear you shows or music etc 7.) I think this is My FAV............I put in a great big 125g sd card and I am loaded to download anything I choose... loads of Movie from the A Amazon Prime Movies,..................ALL of my audio books from Audible.................and a huge amt of my Kindle Books...........I am delighted....... and should get several years out of this tablet in its present format..........ESP. now that google PLAY STORE is on it .Happy Happy Happy......
This is my 4th Kindle Fire, I also have the first generation, an 8.9 HDX and the new 6. The first thing that impresses is how thin and light this new model is, despite being the largest Fire to date. I love the more narrow, widescreen design of the screen, perfect for watching videos and reading books in portrait mode. Anyway, before I get carried away gushing, Ill just list my pros and one or two cons, to make this easier to read and save time.PROS:Wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books.The stereo speakers sound incredible, even better than the previous HDX modelFor comic book readers comics purchased from Amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from Comixology. I was wondering when Amazon was going to incorporate this feature for their comics, finally!Battery life seems to be similar to my 8.9 HDX, but Im happy with that considering the larger screen and thinness of the device.Considerably faster response time across the board.Finally! We can add a micro SD card to expand storage capacity! Yay!The camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous FireCONS:Would have preferred a rubberized back and case. The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet also.Still deciding on the new software layout, maybe its because Im so familiar with the old Fire OS, but lets just say Im not blown away be the design so far.
This was really worth the wait. I bought the Echo Show for my parents, who are elderly, and have a variety of ailments. Since they have arthritis, and a few other issues, I didn't want them to go and answer the doorbell, just to find it's someone soliciting them to buy random junk. So, last year, I bought and installed the Ring Doorbell Pro in their house, which works very well. The Ring Doorbell Pro is hardwired and not battery operated. After the skill was enabled, I could tell Alexa to show me the front doorbell and a video feed automatically pops up. You really need a good Wi-Fi router with the Echo show as the video will be jerky since the video is very high quality. If you have a good Wi-Fi router, the video comes up very quickly and runs very smooth. I thought the doorbell would launch the app on the Echo Show automatically, but it does not. You have to initiate the connection yourself. Hopefully this will be an option in the next iteration of this skill. I can think of a whole bunch of ideas for this skill to do, but for a very first implementation, it works great with the hardwired version of the Ring Doorbell Pro.The battery powered Ring products do not work as great though. When trying to connect the Echo Show to a battery powered Ring device, I get a message saying something like, The camera is asleep and needs to wake up and it could take 30 sec. This happens with my Ring Stickup Camera. So, if you want the best experience, you should buy the Ring Doorbell Pro instead of the battery powered versions.One of my parents just came out of the hospital and sometimes just doesn't have the energy to even pick up a cell phone when we call. So, we have another Echo Show, just for her, in drop in mode.Read more
Initially I gave the Echo Show a 3 star rating. In all fairness after about 20 days of use I've decided to change my score and here's why. First off Amazon reached out to me requesting feed back and advice. I appreciate the concern and their attempts to improve the device. I've also noticed quite a few updates in the short time I've had my Show and honestly things are changing for the better. I've been updating my review and will continue to do so as I've noticed updates and get more hands on experience. After separating my expectations from the actual capabilities of this device I've come to the conclusion that the Show still had me wanting more despite it's capabilities. I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, a dot in my bedroom, and one at work. I have lights, fans, a thermostat, surround sound, and TV all connected to my Alexa devices. Of course I had to buy one with a screen. I'm a big fan of Alexa, the products have become a routine part of my day. As soon as the Show was available to preorder I ordered one without any hesitation.Initially I wanted to put my show on a 70 inch TV stand by my 60 inch TV where my original Echo was. I figured it wouldn't look bad because I could use it as a digital picture frame also. I don't have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a 7 inch screen from 8 feet away wasn't going to work for me. My Show now sits on my kitchen counter. I figured I'd get more use out of it in my living room because most of my Alexa enabled devices are in there and generally I spend more time in my living room than the kitchen. A few people mentioned why don't you put it on your desk.Read more
The Amazon Echo Show is a voice-activated device. You can instruct it to play video content, play music, stream online audio, order products and services, and control home automation products. The Echo Show is the first device of its kind to feature its own screen, which in my opinion, greatly enhances the use and potential of this device.Ive been using this device for a few days so far. Below you will find some of my initial impressions: What I Like Good build quality: The Show has a nice, bright screen that has good viewing angles.Good sound: The speakers on the Show sound much better than the original echo.Easy setup: Setup was extremely easy, mostly due to the Shows touch screen. After making a few selections, the Show was up and running in no time.Content suggestions: When you aren't interacting with the Show, it continuously displays content suggestions. I like that it will suggest videos to watch.Video content: I like being able to view Amazon Video, video news briefings, movie trailers, and YouTube videos on the Show.Video calling: Video calling works as advertised. I like being able to initiate a call with my voice.Music with lyrics: When playing songs from Amazon Music, you can see album art and song lyrics on the screen.Home automation: Like other Echos, the Show can control your smart home products. The show has the extra ability to display camera feeds.On-screen apps: The echo can display my calendar, reminders, lists, timers, local weather, and more. Because of this, I find the Show infinitely more useful than the original Echo. What I Don't Like The Show needs more functionality that leverages the touch screen.Read more

You will have to turn it in a direction that it would be facing you.As far as I can tell you can not cut the screen off completely, which would make this a bad fit for a bedroom. The clock displays in white with the screen in a dim black by using the command turn off the screen. *Update* The screen can be cut off.This device was marketed as a hands free companion in the kitchen for things like recipes. My frustration is when I ask it to pull up a recipe it's inconsistent. Sometimes it wants to send the recipe to my phone, sometimes it wants me to swipe down on the screen to access the cooking directions and ingredients.Read more
I've only had my Echo Show just a little over 24 hours now, so please take that into consideration. I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, a dot in my bedroom, and one at work.

I waited two days to set up Show to give myself a reward for working. I read the majority of the reviews already posted. I have no idea why there is even a one-star review.Setup was a breeze. My Ring Pro screen pops up brilliantly. Nest cameras, too. Played Adele at the maximum volume and sang along with the lyrics Show trickled on the screen.As far as those who boo hoo over the headlines Show displays, you can give her the voice command of DND. Problem solved. Then, just tell her to wake up.I followed the simple instructions on how to change the generic photo on Show's home screen. Easy peasy.Granted, I haven't made a video call yet. Waiting for my folks to get in the game and buy Show.I'm not a lover of all things Amazon. I bought the newest Fire Tablet but returned it after a week. Show redeemed Amazon.If yours isn't working, you either got a dud or you're not doing something right.
First day with the echo show. I'm pretty pleased with it. Some observations that I think have not been hit in most reviews:* Sound quality seems similar to that of the Echo cylinder. Good for a desktop listening experience, not impressive if you want to fill a room with sound.* The Show does have an ambient light sensor (using the camera) so that the screen dims as the room lighting goes down. When I darkened the room at night to work at my PC, the Show display dimmed to the point where I could just make out the time, and not the background photo at all.* Much has been made of the Show displaying lyrics when playing Prime music. That doesn't appeal to me, but when playing music from Spotify, Pandora, and My Music on Amazon, the Show displays the song title, artist name, album art, and a progress indicator. That's really nice when listening to playlists - I was always asking my Echo cylinder Alexa, what's that song* Alexa has always been weak at recognizing the names of some of my Pandora channels. With the show, if Alexa doesn't recognize the name, I can ask it to display my Pandora channels and select them fro mthe Show touch screen, It's good to have a fallback that does not require me to pull out my phone and fire up the Alexa app, then work my way through multiple screens to get my selection.* Some newsfeeds are now accompanied by appropriate photographs.* You can set the Show to use an album from Amazon Prime Photos as a slideshow when the device is inactive. AFAIK, other photo servers cannot be used.
I read all of the reviews of If you have the Fire HDX 8.9 don't buy this 10.1 tablet. The resolution is just as good on the 10.1 as the HDX. Starts up faster that the HDX. It's a nice size not a solid square like the IPAD'S. I saved myself 80.00 by buy the refurbished there is nothing wrong with it. I highly recommend this Kindle over than a high priced IPAD.
I've had 4 kindles and have loved each until now. I tried to save a few bucks by purchasing a refurbished fire 10. I'm so disappointed in its performance. It's slow loading , it freezes up and I have to constantly restart it. Battery life is terrible.
This review is about the certified refurbished Fire HD 10 unit I ordered. It looked and acted like a new unit for 80 less. Still trying to decide if I want to give them back 15 to remove the obnoxious adds on the lock screen. They really aren't that bad.
I purposely waited almost 4 months before leaving a review. I wanted to see if any issues developed before leaving feedback. I was not disappointed. The refurbished fire arrived in perfect condition, no scratches or wear. I purchased a screen cover immediately to insure it would remain in good shape. After 4 months, it works like a champ. No issues whatsoever. VERY PLEASED and would not hesitate purchasing refurbished item again. Amazon has ALWAYS treated me superbly with any issues I might have with orders or returns.
I've owned several different tablets. This one is by far the slowest. And I don't mean it's a little slower. I mean you have to wait up to 2 minutes sometimes for the apps to load onto the screen. Opening apps can be quick or take up to 3 minutes. I've had far more issues with this Fire than any of the others we've owned. If I had realized the difference in speed I would have kept my old one. It's definitely not work the larger screen. It's a crap shoot on a daily basis on how fast it will be. But even on it's fastest day it's significantly slower than the others.
I've had the Kindle Fire HDX 7 inch tablet for almost 3 years and when I compare it to the Fire HD 10, the earlier tablet comes out the big winner. I find the larger tablet considerably slower. Several apps load quite slowly. The battery is consumed much more quickly. Maybe this is not comparing apples with apples, but I had expected at least the same speed.
Have had this probably 3 weeks. Wanted to be fair with my review. The battery in my Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX quit talking to the tablet so had to keep it plugged in to use it. Tried the Fire 8 first and just didn't care for how much smaller the screen was. Returned the 8 waited a bit and ordered the Fire 10. Amazon did give me a discount due to my problem with the 8.9. The Fire 10 in my opinion is no comparison to the 8.9. The apps with the 10 works more like smartphone apps. In the first three days it froze up 4 times. I wondered if it was doing this because I had too many apps opened. Once I started closing the apps I wasn't using I haven't had the tablet freeze problem. I do like the bigger screen on the 10 and the colors are sharp and the pictures clear. I also learned that the 8.9 was no longer being supported by Amazon and that meant no updates so eventually a replacement would have been necessary. Why Amazon stopped the 8.9 is beyond me but I'm doing ok now with the 10. If you get it give it some time.
I've had my hdx 7 going on 3 years, I love it! I needed a larger screen for my eyes, I'm so glad I went with the refurbished, I've only had to get used to the different op system. I don't use this for gaming or movies, I am an avid reader and this is awesome for increasing the size of the pages and font. I did have some problems downloading my books but that's just me and my lack of kindle tech it shouldn't take me too much longer to get used to this newer system.
I have now owned 4 Kindles and just love them! My first one lasted for years and then died of old age and overuse. I had used it so much the printed keypads were all blank. I then got 2 Kindle Fires. I gave one to my daughter and kept the other. I have had no problem with the Fire once I broke down and read some of the direction, if all else fails. Other than operator error I have used it for over a year but it's too heavy for my old overused hands. Not heavy though. Books now give me problems. Even paperbacks. But I then bought the smaller, lighter new Kindle and loved it from the first. I carried in my purse a lot so it froze after a few months. I called customer support and they replaced it with a refurbished one. This time I bought a light weight cover for it. I don't like the added weight of the cover but in order for me to never leave home without it I have to protect it. I have had this one for months and have had no problems. I now have about 600 books awaiting my pleasure! I just looked the Kindles over again. I'm getting paranoid about my little Kindle and am considering having an on site backup although Amazon would get me one here in just a couple of days. Still giving it thought. Basically I love my Kindles and use both of my current ones for different apps.
Very useful for those who enjoy reading and inspiring those who do not have a habit of reading. Needed for anyone not yet
I have the kindle fire but was frustrated when taking it to the beach. This model is easy to read on the beach and was easy to set up. You can't tell that it's refurbished - it looks brand new.
Excelente
DON'T BUY a reburbished Kindle. I've had to return them, twice. Apparently, Amazon's definition of refurbish is to take a Kindle with some problem or defect, simply repackage it and send out again to see if some different customer might take it off their hands.Both times, the 'refurbished' Kindles shorted out in different ways. The Kindles especially liked to misfunction while I was in the middle of working out at the gym.
The refurbished Kindle looks brand new, I wouldn't even know that it was used. The only down side was that when I opened up the package, the Kindle was already on.
Bought a refurbished kindle and literally after one month of owning it the device started to freeze. I had to reboot it multiple times and then it would start working. Went on a trip and it worked as it should but as soon as I returned the battery died and I charged it over night and the next morning the screen was frozen with the character reading a book under a tree. I tried all rebooting methods (20 seconds, 40 seconds, 1 minute) and nothing. Called customer service and was on the phone for an hour. Eventually they said that they could only give me 35 off the next purchase of a new kindle. I was pretty bummed out that a refurbished product of their own was not backed by them. I ended up buying a new kindle with the discount they gave me but should have just went with a new one to begin with since I ended up spending the same amount of money and had way more of a headache to deal with. Now I have to figure out what to do with this new Kindle Paper Weight that I have.
Although I've owned almost every model of Kindle ebook readers since the 2nd generation Kindle that I bought in 2009, I had to think hard about ordering the new Voyage. I was very happy with my Paperwhite (the 2nd generation that was released in the fall of 2013), and as much as I wanted to try the Voyage, I wasn't sure I wanted to spend 199 on one. It became a moot point, though, when my wife ordered the Voyage, saying it was her early Christmas present to me. Now that I've had time to use the Voyage, I have to say I'm impressed. With hardware features like a 300 ppi display, LEDs that automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on the ambient lighting, and the user's choice of a touchscreen or sensors acting like buttons to turn pages, the Voyage is hands down the state-of-the-art e-ink ebook reader. At the end of my review, I'll give my opinion on whether it's worth upgrading from your current ebook reader.When I received the Voyage, the setup was quick (although you do have to go through a brief tutorial), and after downloading a few of my books from the Amazon Cloud and adjusting a few settings, the Voyage was ready to go. Here's a brief comparison of the Voyage and the Paperwhite:Voyage---------Size: 6.4x4.5x0.30Weight (wi-fi version): 6.3 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: Touchscreen plus PagePressDisplay lighting: Adaptive light sensor (automatic) plus manual adjustmentPaperwhite-------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.Read more
Since other people have gone into detail on the device, I will answer only the burning questions I had before I received mine. I was very happy with my Paperwhite and would not have bought this had mine not been stolen/lost (not sure which). My husband still has his Paperwhite, so I was able to compare them side by side.CAN I USE THE WALL CHARGER FROM MY PAPERWHITE TO CHARGE THE VOYAGEYes.CAN PRESSING THE PAGE TURNERS CAUSE REPETITIVE USE ISSUESI don't think so. You can turn down the pressure it needs (which is very slight) or you can turn it off completely and turn pages with a tap. It's actually nice to have both options.CAN YOU SEE WHERE TO TURN THE PAGES IN THE DARKNo. You can guess where the page forward area is, but the page back is a dot, so guessing would be difficult. But you can still tap to turn pages. Using a cover helps, as the edge of the cover would be right over the dot.DOES THE FEEDBACK BUZZ ANNOY YOU WHEN YOU TURN PAGESI think it does take a little getting used to, but you can turn it down, and I think I will not notice it after a while. (There's no sound it's purely tactile.) Months later: It's not distracting you forget about it.IS THE ADJUSTABLE LIGHT NICEI still do it manually. It doesn't adjust the way I'd like it to. Not as bright in good light as I'd like, and not as dim while my husband is sleeping next to me. Note that if you want to use the night light, you have to set that separately from Auto Adjust. Settings/Device Options/Screen Light. I'm not actually sure that the night light is working. It was at 18 when I turned off the light (this is quite bright), and I checked it about 10 minutes later, and it was at 17.Read more
I've got mixed feelings on this one, unfortunately. This review is coming from a kindle enthusiast who has owned or used nearly every variation of the device since the 1st generation.Size Weight---It's noticeably smaller and lighter than the Paperwhite. When I saw the specs it didn't really strike me as something that would make much difference to me, but in real life it's actually great. The Voyage fits into a few of my coat pockets that the Paperwhite was just a little too big to fit into.Origami Cover---I know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the official cover. The origami cover is ugly and I was skeptical, but I actually love it. It's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. This actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. It's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the Voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. The origami part of the case works great as well... it stands vertically or horizontally (if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing).The other great new thing about this case is that the Voyage attaches to it magnetically. It attaches and detaches very easily, unlike the Paperwhite which seemed to be nearly permanently attached to the standard case. This is great because if you decide you want to read the device and appreciate how light/thin it is without a case attached, it's super easy to take it out.It's pricey but worth it.PagePress---One of the new features is PagePress, which has sensors on the outer edge of the device that you can squeeze to turn pages.Read more
Let me guess: you love books, but you're not sure you want to get a kindle because you love the feel of books, rightI'm here to tell you that the kindle is the perfect balance of book and digital format.SHORT REVIEWYes, you should buy a kindle. Get the paperwhite with no ads. You're welcome.LONG REVIEWI love physical books too, I'm with you. But I know myself, and I know that once I forget to take the book I'm reading with me, that's it. I'll start another book and rarely finish the first. I also know if I try and read on my phone or iPad that I'll get distracted and start wondering about what's happening on the internet (Instagram's not gonna scroll ITSELF). Either way I'm not finishing the book.WHY KINDLEThe kindle takes the best of both worlds and mashes them together. The e ink display is honestly incredible. I wish iPhones had an e ink display. It really looks just like a printed page. So you get the experience of reading a physical paper book, but with the perks of being digital.Namely:- Share what book you're reading to Goodreads, Facebook, or twitter (so you can look SMORT)- Built in dictionary (so you can learn the proper spelling of the word SMORT)- Export your highlights as a PDFPlus, it'll also sync with the kindle app on your phone so you can squeeze in the final few pages of the chapter while you're in the bathroom (don't pretend you don't do that.

Review updated September 17, 2015As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing this review from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the 2013, 2014 and new 2015 Paperwhite, the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9. This review is for the 2015 All-New Kindle Paperwhite. The attached picture shows the 2014 Kindle on the left and the new 2015 Kindle on the right. Here is the summary of my initial impressions of the 2015 model versus the 2014 model.I am somewhat disappointed in the 2015 version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model. The Paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation 2012 model to its second generation 2013 model, especially in the display and processor area. The 2013 model came with 2 GB storage, a wonderful display, a great battery and was the e-book workhorse. The second generation 2014 model changed by only increasing storage to 4 GB. The third generation 2015 model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: A Paperwhite device, a quick-start guide and a short USB cord. Amazon still does not supply a power adapter.SIZE: Its the same identical size as the older Paperwhites. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.3 to 7.2 ounces, a fraction of an ounce, most likely because of a smaller battery.The good news is that all cases that fit the other Paperwhites will fit the 2015 version!!DISPLAY: The resolution has been bumped up to 300 ppi, equivalent to the Voyage.Read more
If you're reading reviews of the new 3rd generation Paperwhite, you're likely considering buying one. If so, you're probably in one of these categories:* Never owned a Kindle e-ink reader* Own an older Kindle e-ink reader, but not a Paperwhite* Own a first or second generation PaperwhiteI'll save my opinion on whether the new Paperwhite 3 is worth buying until the end of my review. (But I will say this: They've taken a great product and made it even better.) First, here's a comparison of the new Paperwhite with the second generation Paperwhite (comparisons are for the wi-fi models):Second Generation Paperwhite (2013)-------------------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.3 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 212 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 6Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingAll-New Paperwhite (2015)------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.2 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 7Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingNote that the physical size is identical to the older Paperwhite, so covers and sleeves that worked with the older Paperwhites are still usable (thank you, Amazon). The most obvious difference is the screen resolution: 300 pixels per inch is a major jump from the 212 pixels per inch in the older Paperwhites.Read more
Let me guess: you love books, but you're not sure you want to get a kindle because you love the feel of books, rightI'm here to tell you that the kindle is the perfect balance of book and digital format.SHORT REVIEWYes, you should buy a kindle. Get the paperwhite with no ads. You're welcome.LONG REVIEWI love physical books too, I'm with you. But I know myself, and I know that once I forget to take the book I'm reading with me, that's it. I'll start another book and rarely finish the first. I also know if I try and read on my phone or iPad that I'll get distracted and start wondering about what's happening on the internet (Instagram's not gonna scroll ITSELF). Either way I'm not finishing the book.WHY KINDLEThe kindle takes the best of both worlds and mashes them together. The e ink display is honestly incredible. I wish iPhones had an e ink display. It really looks just like a printed page. So you get the experience of reading a physical paper book, but with the perks of being digital.Namely:- Share what book you're reading to Goodreads, Facebook, or twitter (so you can look SMORT)- Built in dictionary (so you can learn the proper spelling of the word SMORT)- Export your highlights as a PDFPlus, it'll also sync with the kindle app on your phone so you can squeeze in the final few pages of the chapter while you're in the bathroom (don't pretend you don't do that. You're either on your phone or you're reading the febreeze ingredients)READING IN BEDThe backlight looks great. It's a perfect size.Read more

I'm a long time Kindle user, and have upgraded a number of times. Every upgrade was a significant improvement, and the Oasis continues that trend. I love my Voyage, but the Oasis makes it feel like a hardback book. The pictures and descriptions don't do the size and weight justice. Shockingly light, and small even with the case. Used without the case, it's like holding a few sheets of paper. Amazing. Haven't had it long enough to evaluate the battery life, but never had a problem with the previous models, so I assume the promise of much longer battery life (with the secondary battery in the case) is accurate.The balance in the hand without the case is stunningly good. With the case feels a bit like the Voyage (although quite a bit lighter than my Voyage in its case). Case is high quality and easy to put on and take off as needed. Screen seems a smidge clearer and higher definition than my Voyage (maybe due to the updated lighting system).I had the 'pressure sensitive' page turner option on my Voyage turned off. Much too jumpy and sensitive, even at its 'hard' setting. I won't miss that. The new mechanical buttons on the Oasis are AWESOME. Nice upgrade there, and nice to not have to touch the screen for the most part.Yes, it is pricey. I would say if you are a 'few hour a week' reader, the Paperwhite is your best bet (solid performance and very good price/value). But if you are a reading fanatic who reads a lot every day (like me!), the extra battery life and the balance/size/weight, along with the slightly improved screen is WELL worth the money, especially when spread over the life of the unit.Edit: A few more comments now that I've been using the Oasis for a number of months.Read more
Note: My original Kindle Oasis review was posted on 4/29/16 on this product page on Amazon: New - Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover. This page is for the same product but for purchasers who wish to use it outside of the U.S. My original review follows.UPDATE 7/24/16: After using my Oasis for almost 3 months, I thought I would add a brief comment to my original review. I have settled on using the Oasis for reading in bed, where it's lighter and easier to hold and I prefer the page turn button style. For my reading elsewhere, for example if I want to read while eating, I use my Voyage w/origami case to hold it upright. I can read the same book using both Kindles since they stay synch'd to one another, and it's given me basically the best of both worlds, at least for my style of reading. The Voyage with cover almost seems clunky - bulkier and heavier - compared to the Oasis, but when it's sitting on a table it hardly matters. I have to say that I'm fortunate in being able to afford both, and the new base model Kindle that I recently picked up is not yet getting much use, even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non-illuminated display works just fine. My original review follows.---------Amazon released the first Kindle in November of 2007. Eight and a half years later, the Oasis model is the 8th generation Kindle and the third evolution of Kindle with built-in illumination. The price of 300+ was a bit of a shock, but I ordered mine as soon as it was announced on April 13th.Read more
This is my 4th Kindle since I bought my first one as soon as Kindle was launched. With every new model, I was fascinated by the improvements and kept recommending them to friends. The Voyager was the first time I felt somewhat frustrated with an Amazon product.Yes, it is lighter and even easier to read than my previous models - if you are buying your first one, don't hesitate - it is still a great product and still much more comfortable to use than trying to read a book on an iPad - even if it is an iPad Mini.But... There are a few things that I thing Amazon should fix on this one, specially because it is the top of the line Kindle:1. The battery cover just keeps disconnecting from the reader itself. The magnetic attachment is just not strong enough to keep it in position as you manipulate the reader. Previous covers just stayed in place and even the Apple magnetic cover attaches better than this one.2. As you are able to turn off the page buttons on the side, you should be able to turn off page turning on the screen. The way I got used to handle the kindle and as I constantly change hands when I am reading, I get a lot of undesired page turns because I touched the screen somewhere. A very simple fix that could be in one of the next software updates that would greatly improve my perception of the device.3. Battery life (even with the cover) is far from what I expected. My old Kindle had a battery that lasted for more than a month, the new one needs recharging every 15 days.4. The device itself is so light and the battery cover so cumbersome that it should come with a simple,e cover just to protect the screen when you throw it in the bag.5.Read more
The new Fire HDX 8.9 is definitely one powerful tablet, packed with some pretty nice features. While it does have some small flaws here and there, it generally is an all around great buy. I'll go over some of what I've noticed using the tablet, what I've learned from others who are using it, as well as the specs and how I feel about them. Hopefully it'll give you more insight into the product and help you make an easier decision whether or not to buy it.*** BUILD QUALITY ***One of the first things I noticed was the outstanding build quality. The tablet weighs less than much of its competition, and provides a nice feel due to the materials used in making the case which gives you a nice grip so you don't drop the tablet as easily. Everything feels solid... it doesn't have that cheap feel that some of the Android based tablets have. Apple still holds the title for most durable case as it's aluminum but unless you plan on throwing this thing around, you don't need the aluminum... it weighs more and it's cold!*** SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR AND GPU ***This new HDX 8.9 comes with the 2.5Ghz Snapdragon processor and a nice GPU so this is going to be one of your fastest tablets on the market at the moment, if not the fastest. Intel and NVIDIA are continuously working on CPU's for the tablet and Chromebook markets, bragging about their performance and how they blow away the competition. Acer, for example, is utilizing an NVIDIA Tegra K1 ARM based CPU running at 2.1GHz quad-core. That is insanely fast for something like a Chromebook which functionality wise, is pretty much the same thing as a tablet. Unfortunately for Acer, the Snapdragon CPU on the Fire HDX is more powerful (2.5 GHz vs. 2.1 GHz) and appears to be using less power.Read more
Great device it's zippy, has an AWESOME display, great sound for a tablet (rivals/bests any portable device I currently own, including laptops) has incredible ease of use and I'm basically all-in on the Amazon ecosystem. I know people lament the loss of Google Play, but I'm a simple guy who doesn't actually need absolutely everything. I can watch movies/videos from the major streaming services I use (Netflix/Prime), music (Pandora, Spotify, Prime), the various apps I use for fantasy sports, reading emails, ebooks (honestly the main reason I bought this thing), and reddit. That's more or less all I need it to do, and it does all of these things beautifully and quickly.The reason for the 3 star is because, as of this review, the device has the SUPREMELY ANNOYING HABIT OF LOCKING UP. It seems to happen most often when I'm running a music program while reading or browsing then attempting to shutting it off. It occurs to me anywhere from once to three times a day, but this is a device that I only use when I'm traveling around or somewhere away from my home computer, so those 1-3 times happen at the most inconvenient opportunities.Example of a recent situation: I'm waiting for my class to start so I'm hanging out at the college library, listening to some stuff on Prime while flipping through reddit, with headphones on. It's time to go in, so I switch to the music app to shut it off and simultaneously remove the headphones to put it in my bag. Except it locks up the screen stops moving, I lose any and all functions to use it, and the music just KEEPS ON PLAYING. I can't shut it off.Read more
I'm writing this review with the benefit of being an experienced Kindle Fire user vs. someone brand new to the Kindle family. In summary, you are getting a great deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding. If you are a first-time large-screen tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration in comparison to more expensive versions, I'd recommend it. If you're comparing last year's HDX model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to last year's Fire HDX but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the Fire, setup took a while: despite being a brand new product, the Fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates. You just need to be patient while it downloads and installs.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the best screen display of any previous model of Fire and looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp in a side-by-side comparison to last years HDX version and my iPad Air (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work): I compared the viewing experience watching an episode of The Lost Ship.Read more

The price of 300+ was a bit of a shock, but I ordered mine as soon as it was announced on April 13th. I then spent the next two weeks reading what was available online describing the features and benefits and asking myself whether or not I had made the right decision. Now that its finally been released and I have it in my hands, how different is it, and is it worth what appears at first to be a very high price(My Kindle experience: I purchased my first Kindle (a first generation Paperwhite), when it was first released in Sept 2012. I purchased the Voyage when it was first released, in Sept 2014.Read more
Okay, if you don't want to read my whole review, I'll summarize it right here: The Oasis is the most technologically advanced e-ink reader that Amazon - or anyone else, for that matter - has produced to date. But is it worth 290 for the least expensive version (wi-fi only with ads) In my opinion, the answer is no, not when the very capable Paperwhite is available for 100 (at the time I'm writing this). But I'm sure that there is a market for the Oasis, probably for the techno-geeks and gadgeteers like myself who love trying new products like the Oasis, and serious readers who want the absolute best possible experience in reading. But for the typical reader, I just don't think the Oasis adds enough to the reading experience to be worth the high price, especially for those who already have a Paperwhite or Voyage.For reference, here's a brief comparison of the Oasis with the Paperwhite and the Voyage:Oasis (2016)-----------------------------Size: 5.6x4.8x0.13-0.33 (thickness varies)Weight (wi-fi version): 4.6 ounces (without battery case)Display: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED front-litStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: Touchscreen plus page turn buttonsNumber of fonts: 9Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lighting (10 LEDs)Third Generation Paperwhite (2015)------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.Read more
I am a fairly voracious reader - 120+ books/year, almost all on Kindle. I have purchased every Kindle edition as soon as it was announced. The price doesn't bother me too much, as I figure with as much as I read, I make the money back by buying Kindle vs. hardcover books (since I mostly read new releases). This is the first Kindle that I sent back though.It's not that the Oasis isn't great - it is. The display is slightly crisper than previous Kindles. It's not that it isn't set up well - the buttons are placed well and easy to use, and the touch screen works fine. It's really just a matter of personal preference. I love to read while I have coffee in the morning and while I'm eating lunch at work, and because of that I love the origami case that the Voyage has. It's hard to read the Oasis hands-free, especially if you are used to the Voyage. Also, when reading while laying down, I switch hands unconsciously a couple of times a minute. I didn't realize this until I used the Oasis, because with the Oasis you have to flip the Kindle over, which may not seem like a big deal, but it definitely does not create a seamless reading experience.So if you like to read while eating or laying down then you are probably better off using the Voyage. If you want the best looking read, then the Oasis is great. And regardless, you are better off reading any Kindle than you are watching the garbage on TV!
I have owned literally (and I mean literally) every Kindle since the first one. All the keyboard versions that followed the first one, the Touch, the Paperwhite, the Voyage. All the Fires since the first one, all the different sizes from 10 to 6 and every gen in between. (I know, I am a little crazy.) Many of these are still in use among family members and my habit was to switch between Fires depending on mood. My last attempt was an iPad Mini, used only as an eReader, and for the first time in many years I bought books from somewhere other than Amazon, because I found the iBooks experience so pleasant. Bottom line... I was always seeking a Kindle that fit all my needs as a book and nothing more. Stop the press. I have found it.Lets put a little context around this. I eventually migrated to the Fires because although I liked the eInk for reading, I also liked to see more detail on book covers and black and white didn't seem to offer that. The Paperwhite and it's successors got closer, so that even without color the detail was sufficient to make browsing by cover satisfactory (something I have always done, even with real books).Still though, what I didn't like about the eInk versions was the inability to render a page without big gaps between words or even truncated lines when there was a big or hyphenated word in the line. I don't know whether it is just coincidence that I haven't seen that yet with the Oasis, or whether the Amazon Ember font helps (I like this new font a lot) or whether it has been specifically addressed in the newer OS. Whatever, I have not seen that yet and it removes one of my reasons for preferring a tablet over an eReader.First impressions... not great.Read more
I don't know why there are so many bad reviews. First of, let's start off by pointing out the obvious, it's under 100. You're not going to receive a Kindle Paperwhite. Before you order, read the specs and compare it to the other Kindles. Yes, the specs say it doesn't have backlighting so honestly, there shouldn't be one ounce of surprise when you receive this. I on the other hand, love this little Kindle. I have had the new Kindle Paperwhite and I really didn't like how big it was to hold in my small hands. I don't have children hands, but I'm a female and my hands are on the small side. Maybe for a male this would be kind of small, Idk. Anyway, it is smaller than the Paperwhite, but I love that. I also love the fact that it doesn't come with a light. I used to read at night with the Paperwhite, but that light gave me a headache so I stopped. It is NOT as dark as these bad reviews make it seem. You can read perfectly fine being indoors. They're exaggerating. This feels more like a book to me than the Kindle Paperwhite ever did. The letters on this Kindle are amazing. I don't even notice the difference between ppi and I love that the letters are way darker than the Paperwhite. The paperwhite had a grey hue to them and I didn't feel like I was reading a book. I felt like I actually holding a technical device to read a book. Of course since this doesn't have a backlight, you cannot read in the dark. It's common sense. If you want to read at night, purchase a little book light that are super inexpensive and attach it to your kindle. It's not a big deal and you're not going to break the bank buying a 119.99 item when you can buy this little awesome e-book reader for 79.99. Think about when the light runs out of your expensive other e-books...Read more
If you read the KNOW WHAT YOU ARE BUYING review for the Kindle prior to this one then you know where I am going. Already this new Kindle is riddled with one star reviews from people that seem to not have read the product description. Here goes:*THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!*THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE GAMING CAPABILITY!*THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!Like a regular book you just might HAVE A HARD TIME READING THIS KINDLE IN BED AT NIGHT WITH LOW LIGHTING!What you will get though is an awesome entry level Kindle with software almost identical to the higher end models. The print looks flawless outside, by a window, or under a lamp, in other words, just like a real book.
There are sadly a lot of negative reviews on here, so I though I would add my positive one.I had a second-generation Kindle many years ago, and it has since stopped working. I finally decided to buy a new one.I chose the basic Kindle because that's exactly what I wanted -- a bare-bones e-reader. I have no need for a tablet or anything of the sort. This Kindle delivers on that front in every way possible.At first, I thought I would miss the page turn buttons, and dislike the touch screen. However, I have been delightfully surprised. Tapping the edge of the screen to turn the page is incredibly easy and less intrusive than pushing a button, which was always a nice little jarring reminder that I wasn't, in fact, reading a paperback. The small, quick tap of my thumb on the edge of the screen has become almost like a reflex and I don't notice it anymore it feels natural.I do slightly miss the metal backing of the older Kindles it made them feel a bit sturdier, whereas this basic Kindle is just hard plastic. However, I suspect that using a metal casing would up the price considerably, and I feel that the cheaper price of this basic Kindle far outweighs that slight drawback.I bit the bullet and bought one without the special offers. I do not want ads intruding my Kindle experience, even if they only show as the screensaver or on a bar across the bottom of the Home screen. It is just distasteful to me, and the extra 30 was worth it to me to avoid the ads.I do not need or want a case for my Kindle. I do not like to read with a case on, and it would be cumbersome to remove my Kindle from its case every time I want to read.Read more
To all the people saying it's too dark. It's literally the same screen as the older devices. Look at comparison. If anything the new Kindle (on right) is lighter than the previous device.
I was so shocked! So, I was going through a book for my PhD dissertation, highlighting parts for further citations in my project. When I was done with it, I realised that instead of scrolling back all the pages of my e-book, looking for the highlights, I can just export them to my e-mail in PDF file. This is life changing for me! I have always preferred paper books to e-books, but this option is a miracle. It saved me hours of work! I am a very happy customer!
Love the new Kindle! Priced right (with an extra 20 off!), even smaller in my hands than the Kindle with keyboard. I was sad to lose my old Kindle, but this one is just terrific.
Although I've owned almost every model of Kindle ebook readers since the 2nd generation Kindle that I bought in 2009, I had to think hard about ordering the new Voyage. I was very happy with my Paperwhite (the 2nd generation that was released in the fall of 2013), and as much as I wanted to try the Voyage, I wasn't sure I wanted to spend 199 on one. It became a moot point, though, when my wife ordered the Voyage, saying it was her early Christmas present to me. Now that I've had time to use the Voyage, I have to say I'm impressed. With hardware features like a 300 ppi display, LEDs that automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on the ambient lighting, and the user's choice of a touchscreen or sensors acting like buttons to turn pages, the Voyage is hands down the state-of-the-art e-ink ebook reader. At the end of my review, I'll give my opinion on whether it's worth upgrading from your current ebook reader.When I received the Voyage, the setup was quick (although you do have to go through a brief tutorial), and after downloading a few of my books from the Amazon Cloud and adjusting a few settings, the Voyage was ready to go. Here's a brief comparison of the Voyage and the Paperwhite:Voyage---------Size: 6.4x4.5x0.30Weight (wi-fi version): 6.3 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: Touchscreen plus PagePressDisplay lighting: Adaptive light sensor (automatic) plus manual adjustmentPaperwhite-------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.Read more
Since other people have gone into detail on the device, I will answer only the burning questions I had before I received mine. I was very happy with my Paperwhite and would not have bought this had mine not been stolen/lost (not sure which). My husband still has his Paperwhite, so I was able to compare them side by side.CAN I USE THE WALL CHARGER FROM MY PAPERWHITE TO CHARGE THE VOYAGEYes.CAN PRESSING THE PAGE TURNERS CAUSE REPETITIVE USE ISSUESI don't think so. You can turn down the pressure it needs (which is very slight) or you can turn it off completely and turn pages with a tap. It's actually nice to have both options.CAN YOU SEE WHERE TO TURN THE PAGES IN THE DARKNo. You can guess where the page forward area is, but the page back is a dot, so guessing would be difficult. But you can still tap to turn pages. Using a cover helps, as the edge of the cover would be right over the dot.DOES THE FEEDBACK BUZZ ANNOY YOU WHEN YOU TURN PAGESI think it does take a little getting used to, but you can turn it down, and I think I will not notice it after a while. (There's no sound it's purely tactile.) Months later: It's not distracting you forget about it.IS THE ADJUSTABLE LIGHT NICEI still do it manually. It doesn't adjust the way I'd like it to. Not as bright in good light as I'd like, and not as dim while my husband is sleeping next to me. Note that if you want to use the night light, you have to set that separately from Auto Adjust. Settings/Device Options/Screen Light. I'm not actually sure that the night light is working. It was at 18 when I turned off the light (this is quite bright), and I checked it about 10 minutes later, and it was at 17.Read more
I've got mixed feelings on this one, unfortunately. This review is coming from a kindle enthusiast who has owned or used nearly every variation of the device since the 1st generation.Size Weight---It's noticeably smaller and lighter than the Paperwhite. When I saw the specs it didn't really strike me as something that would make much difference to me, but in real life it's actually great. The Voyage fits into a few of my coat pockets that the Paperwhite was just a little too big to fit into.Origami Cover---I know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the official cover. The origami cover is ugly and I was skeptical, but I actually love it. It's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. This actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. It's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the Voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. The origami part of the case works great as well... it stands vertically or horizontally (if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing).The other great new thing about this case is that the Voyage attaches to it magnetically. It attaches and detaches very easily, unlike the Paperwhite which seemed to be nearly permanently attached to the standard case. This is great because if you decide you want to read the device and appreciate how light/thin it is without a case attached, it's super easy to take it out.It's pricey but worth it.PagePress---One of the new features is PagePress, which has sensors on the outer edge of the device that you can squeeze to turn pages.Read more
Updated 6/617 - so useful we now have 3 of these along with the full sized echo Amazon Echo - BlackAfter using the full sized Echo for a couple of months thought it would be nice to expand on that one piece of hardware. I had no experience with the 'Dot' so i went ahead and shopped for the refurbished (a first as well.) The Dot arrived in a small plain box. Upon removal found the Dot to look just like new. No blemishes, scuffs, dings, nothing whatsoever to indicate based on appearance it was anything other than new. it comes with plug, usb charging cable.that said what matters most is how it functions. i was concerned being refurbished but no worries it worked just as good as new. the device works exactly the same as the full sized Echo. For myself the biggest difference was the addition of a 3.5mm aux out jack. While you can pair both this and its larger 'big brother' to any Bluetooth speaker i have a set of wired Bose headphones and needed that extra bit so i could use them too.how do the Dot full sized Echo compare differences are surprisingly few. as said the Dot has a 3.5mm jack so you can use it with any wired speaker, headphones or earbuds while the Echo does not. the Dot when listening to speech or low volumes other sounds very good and at the same volume level i could not tell a difference between either of the two. however at higher volumes the Dot struggles with the larger Echo easily winning out. otherwise but for appearance they both function the same.as for what the Echo or smaller version Dot can doRead more
I was very hesitant to purchase a refurbished unit, but the discount at the time of my purchase was too good to pass up. I was fully planning on returning it if there was the slightest sign of an issue. I have had this unit for about a month now, and it has worked perfectly since I received it. Like a brand new unit. If you can get this refurb for a substantial discount, I think it is totally worth the risk of not buying a new unit.Edit (07/08/2017): My original refurb'ed Echo Dot is still going strong, and I received my second refurb'ed Echo Dot yesterday. This second one is just as like new as my first one. The packaging is similarly like new. It has the same clear sticker covers surrounding it like a new unit, and I believe the power adapter, cable, and manuals are all actually brand new.
This was a birthday gift from my daughter. (71st birthday--certified old guy) What might I do with an Echo I bought a 3 Kindle book on using an Echo. Later I discovered most of what is in the book is probably in the on board helps, but the book makes a nice linear presentation that does not make me guess what I need to search out, and a Kindle book makes it easy for me to make notes I can find later with ease.I am using my Echo primarily as a radio. In the early 1990s I worked on my German skills by listening to a lot of shortwave radio. Most of that is now on the Internet. I could listen on my smart phone, but that uses phone battery reserves. The Echo runs on AC power from a wall outlet. The little speaker is adequate for voice broadcasts. I listen for hours to German news magazines. I can also listen to some old favorite broadcasts from Radio Canada.We live where my favorite talk radio program comes in poorly due to another station very near on the dial. But, our WiFi reaches my garage workshop and I have clear audio through Tune In. (I am having trouble linking iHeart Radio, perhaps because my subscription is not paid.)When I have asked Alexa a question she sometimes tells me she cannot answer a question I thought simple enough.I did ask for some music and was surprised to find CDs I bought as gifts are in Amazon's cloud for me to hear over Echo. Nice!
Everything works pretty great, doesn't always catch what I say.. But definitely worth the purchase. I am very pleased.
I'm totally enjoying my Echo Dot! I have it synced to my Google Calendar and am able to let Alexa tell me what's on the agenda for the day. I can quickly ask her to set a timer or an alarm and easily find out about the local weather. I also have it synced to my Pandora account but you have to be specific about a saved station name when you want to listen to Pandora. I really wish I could just say shuffle my Pandora stations. That would be awesome! The speaker on the Dot isn't as loud as I would like it but if I'm sitting close by, it's good enough I guess. I've seen an option to add an external speaker but I haven't gotten around to doing that yet. And my 6 yo grandson loves to ask her to tell him a joke! I live in a small town and am probably not able to utilize the full potential of Alexa but I'm not regretting my purchase.
This is a nice compliment to my echo. Connected to my bt speaker it is actually a step up and less expensive than the echo. If I had it to do over again I'd have bought 2 of the dots instead.

I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!
Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more

I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more

Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more
I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!
Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more

Listen, I am basically an Amazon fanboy...I do a lot of shopping thru Amazon, so it pains me to write this review, but it's gotta be done. Corporate stupidity just HAS to be addressed.I have a couple Roku's, a Google Chromecast, a couple TiVo's, etc.(1) Voice search is nice, but searching overall is UNACCEPTABLE as it is NOT a universal search, like on Roku (i.e...search ALL sources for a movie, etc, not just Amazon).(2) Will there EVER be a way, Amazon (are you listening), to search Prime for the FREE content The Fire TV doesn't do it. Unacceptable.(3) The Roku 3 has a headphone jack on the remote...BRILLIANT...this simply has to be a standard feature on these kinds of boxes...but the Fire TV does not have it. Unacceptable.(4) No HBOGO. Unacceptable.(5) No volume control. OK, none of these boxes have what would be a VERY desirable feature...a volume control on the remote...so the Fire TV does not lack here compared to the competition, but it sure seems like Amazon should have figured out how desirable a volume control would be, and included it.(6) Adding android apps is very hard for average users.
All is as advertised and am enjoying Amazon Prime on the large screen TV instead of my computer monitor. Installation and operation a snap.
Wasn't sure how this would work with my rural DSL but it is WONDERFUL. I haven't had any problems with it at all. It is easy to use and the voice command works just as they said it would. So very, very glad I bought it. Loads of stuff to watch. I have been able to catch up with some series I have missed, especially the BBC ones that I dearly love. I recommend it to anyone who likes variety in what they can watch. Along with my Amazon Prime most everything is FREE..that is an added bonus. Try it, you'll like it.
I am very happy with the ease of set up and the voice control is fantastic It makes selecting a movie so much easier than the other pay for movie services.
I connected one end of the hdm1 cable into hdm1 port so on. turned on tv. no screen guide for set up

I love this product. It is easy to use and install.
I really enjoy the Amazon Fire TV. I only have trouble locating all of the Amazon Prime movies and tv shows in one grouping. I wish I could stream only the movies and tv shows that is included with my Prime membership. Otherwise, this device works excellent. The install was a breeze. Glad I purchased it.

I ordered this as soon as it was available and it arrived this morning. For background, I also have an Apple TV, which I hate but my kids love. I also have various WDTV models, Which I love. The reason the kids love the Apple TV is that the interface is so slick and quick, which the WDTV certainly lacks in. This Fire TV is even better IMO than the Apple TV and the WDTV doesn't even come close. Unfortunately, the Fire TV misses in a huge way for me by not allowing the play of external content through the USB port from attached storage or memory stick. If it had that capability, and hopefully it will in the future This would be the perfect device. This is why I am still hanging on to my WDTV as my go to player. It will play virtually any file format you throw at it which is a priority to me. I have been reading about the Plex app and that may satisfy my needs as well, but I haven't dug deeper or tested it out. If that is not the case for you, than the Fire TV would be a great option. I am not familiar with Roku, because I could never justify the purchase due to the inability to play content from local storage. Unfortunately I jumped the gun with the Fire TV because I saw that it did have a USB port and made the assumption it would support external content. Hopefully this will come in a future firmware release otherwise maybe Plex will be able to fill that gap for me. Bottom line, if external content is not important, I would recommend this Fire TV due to the availability of Prime content and the fact the interface is beautiful and very quick. The Apple TV should only be a consideration over this if you are a fanatic Apple loyalist, or you have a tremendous amount of itunes content you want to be able to utilize.

A powerful new streaming box that challenges the competitionPros:-- Sleek, thin, good looking and powerful hardware - fastest box available currently-- Good video and sound output (HDMI, Optical Audio out)-- Fast, responsive UI and streaming - good hardware/firmware, ASAP feature works well-- Nice remote with novel Voice Search feature (works very well)-- Gaming controller and internal GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)-- Games are fun on the Fire TV, graphics are surprisingly good-- Decent array of apps at launch, tons of content available-- Quiet, cool operation, super easy set-up and easy to use-- Good support for local networked content via Plex Media Server and apps-- Potentially great gaming with some good titles available now (Asphalt 8, Riptide GP2, Sev Zero)Cons:-- No SD card slot or other local storage expansion-- USB port not functional Some reports say a USB keyboard will work, have not tried it yet.-- Voice Search only for Amazon content currently-- Some apps (HBOGO, RDIO, etc.) not yet available-- No HDMI or Audio cables included-- No easy way to search free Prime Video content only (mixed in with pay to view)-- Could use a head-phone jack and/or std. audio out as well as opticalWith a 1.7 GHz quad-core CPU, 2 GB of RAM, a GPU and 8 GB internal storage, the Fire TV represents a big leap forward in power for a streaming set-top box. Add in dual-band wifi, ethernet, and Bluetooth support as well as a USB 2.0 port (not useful at present), HDMI, and optical audio out and you have a sleek and capable hardware unit, though missing a few nice things like an SD-card slot(Amazon wants you to use the cloud or networked storage). The power and memory at hand here promise a fast, smooth user experience and the Fire does seem to deliver that based on my initial use. With these specs, this is the fastest box out there, currently.This is also a box that is somewhat serious about gaming support as it has an internal/onboard GPU and an available controller. Many game developers seem excited about the prospects (and market) this device represents. (Currently, you get a free game and 1000 Amazon coins for each controller you purchase.) *** Update, I have tried several games and they are great fun. Graphics are surprisingly good, controls smooth, really pretty impressive for this type of system. ***With 1080p streaming and Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Surround Sound the picture and sound is great. It runs Android (basically 4.4.2 KitKat) so lots of apps should be available right out of the gate with lots more to follow.Some people are grousing about the 99 price, but I do not feel it is out of line at all, and indeed, it seems like a bargain compared to the competition's hardware capabilities to me. You get a decent amount of performance hardware for your money, so I think it's fine (and I'm sure there will be specials later for those who can wait). I could not wait myself and ordered one immediately. I like the Roku (I own several), but this was too tempting to a geek like me.Clearly, the Fire TV aims to challenge the other contenders such as Apply TV, Roku, and Chromecast. Each has their strengths and weaknesses, but the Fire TV seems like it will appeal to many. You might not be too tempted if you already have a Roku 3, but if you are a resident of the Amazon ecosystem, you may find the Fire a great asset. Those new to the game will find it worthy of consideration.There are still a few rough edges as with any new product, but none that seem too significant to me. Most will probably be addressed in short order, but the main thing is that there's plenty out of the box that Amazon got right and the Fire delivers a great experience. Set-up is very easy and straight-forward.The Bluetooth remote is a nice touch, for example, and the voice search is promising. While it currently seems limited to Amazon content, hopefully this will expand at some point. Even so, it's fun to use.Streaming seems to be smooth and glitch free in my tests so far(mostly with Amazon Prime Instant and Netflix). I will do more testing and update this review as I learn more. Load times are generally very fast, sometimes almost instantaneous, and the Fire TV is quite responsive. Video quality is very good.The menu is decent enough, similar to Roku and others. It is a bit Amazon-centric as you might expect. Hopefully future updates will allow one to customize it a bit more. But simple and sweet is what most people want and that's what you get here. Your Amazon video library and watch lists are available, of course.A lot of my favorites like Prime Instant, Netflix, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and so on are here. (Rdio is missing and I hope it gets added soon.) I'm sure all the main ones will get on board, it's just too big a market to ignore.I have not had time to set-up Plex yet, but that promises to be a great feature for sharing photos, music, and videos from other devices, including a PC, laptop, or tablet. I have Plex in the past and it generally worked very well. I will be very interested to see how it goes with the Fire TV (and will update here).Amazon seems to have taken particular care to address the buffering issues sometimes experienced with devices of this type and I have not seen any such issues, so far, at all. NiceMore to come as I have more time and experience with this device. Giving it a solid 4 stars for now pending further time with it. I really like the Fire TV and likely will upgrade to 5 stars if no glitches turn up. *** Upgraded to 5 stars *** Everything working well, gaming is a lot of fun, gfx better than expected. Everything loads faster than any other system I have used (Sony, Netgear, Roku, etc.). Everything looks great. I feel like the value is there, especially if you are already in the Amazon ecosystem. (But non-Amazon stuff like the Netflix app also work well.)I hooked my Amazon Fire TV up my Epson projector and gamed big and it was a blast. Prime Instant Vids and Netflix looked great as well. The fast, responsive interface and overall snappy performance make for a great experience.Gaming:I got RipTide GP2 for the Amazon Fire TV. Still waiting for my game controller, so played using only the Fire TV remote, but even so it was a lot of fun (especially big screen using my projector). Reminds me of PlayStation games (a good thing). The graphics are darn good, better than I expected, and the game is a lot of fun and fairly easy to pickup and play. The game controls work well, even using just the remote. This is the first game I've tried on the Fire TV and I was very surprised and pleased with the quality. Definitely worth a try if you like racing games.*** Update - got my controller - works well - Asphalt 8, Riptide GP2, and Sev Zero all look great and play great. Very impressive I think the Fire TV is going to surprise a lot of people in the area of gaming. ***Tip: In Parental Controls, you can set up a PIN (or use your existing one) and enable pin protected purchasing so that a PIN is required for any purchase made via the Fire TV. Although meant primarily to prevent kids from purchasing without a parent's approval, it's can also serve to prevent accidental 'one-click' purchases of your own.-----Note: If you're interested in more details, you can find PDF's of the User Guide, Quick Start, Controller Manuals and so on here: www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.htmlnodeId201348270
Out of the box mine updated and setup fine. - No ProblemsMy biggest complaint is that Voice Search only searches Amazon and a very few things from HuluPlus... Should search ALL content from at least the Big 3 (Netflix, AmazonPrime HuluPlus)Had some picture glitches on HuluPlus Netflix. I switched over to my Roku3 on the same content and worked just fine...I didn't like the Menus... Not as easy as Roku...Netflix looks and works WAY BETTER on Roku3...I think this might become a player in the market that Roku owns... Maybe... But has too many problems for me to bet on that at full price... I might buy one later when they go on sale and the software's been tweaked... Along with more channels added...Considering you can buy a Roku 3 for the same money or less, with a HUGE list of public private channels, also search that really works... The Fire TV is, at this point, a very bad choice... Don't pay them list price to be a Fire TV Beta Tester...
I am not pleased, every movie I select is a pay for view. It's a good thing Netflix on it. Every movie that is a pay for view can be found on Netflix. I don't need this device, Netflix is available on Cable one.
I like it but the most used app is Netflix. This Netflix app version is older and a pain to use. Why they have this outdated one, doesn't make any sense.
I purchase almost everything with the exception of food from Amazon. I have been a prime member since the inception of the program. Without exception, I have always received EXCELLENT customer service. Until now. I'm having difficulty with my Fire TV connecting to my wifi. Last Saturday I spent approximately 1- hours (maybe 2) troubleshooting with two women techs on the phone. Mary (who I was passed to from the first tech because of her expertise) said she thought it wasn't just a problem unique to me and asked me if she could call me back on Sunday after researching the problem. I had no problem with that. No call on Sunday so I called on Monday. Much to my surprise, there was no record of my call attached to my file. The rep was confused as to whether I was talking about fire wire or Fire TV so I was first sent to a different department. Finally, I got through that fire wire was not the same as Fire TV and I was transferred back to digital. We went through the same troubleshooting taking up a lot of my time. I was willing to do it until we were going around in circles and my phone was running out of juice. The gentleman asked me if he could research and call me later in the day. NO CALL. It's Tuesday--still no call.It really pains me to have to say anything negative about Amazon's Customer Service as it has NEVER BEEN LESS THAN EXCELLENT IN THE PAST. I've noticed I haven't gotten a survey as I usually do after a customer service call. Whoever Amazon has farmed out their digital customer service to will ruin their excellent customer service reputation and they will lose sales because of it. I'm going to wager a bet that there is no record of the 3-4 hours of my time on the phone trying to solve a problem and no record of two promises to call me back. I would have had more respect for these reps if I had received a call saying they were sorry, but they weren't able to come up with a solution for me.I'm hoping Amazon has kept a record of my past reviews and will review my account and see just how much I've spent over the years as a loyal customer. I'm very disappointed that I had to write this review, and I'm hoping someone who can change things reads this and saves Amazon's reputation. I can't be the only one receiving this kind of treatment. It's obvious that the people who are techs for Fire TV are not the same techs that I've dealt with in the past. In fact, I don't think they are even in the same country. What a pity.
For starters, there are only a few of the free Prime shows listed. There should be a section where all of the prime shows are placed and easy to find. Shows should only be listed once and then after clicking the show artwork the seasons available. 150 shows are all spread out so it is annoying having to go through them all. Show seasons aren't even together. It is a mess that needs to be sorted. Yes, there is voice search but, if you don't know what Prime videos are available you could spend days trying to find something to watch...or, just give up and go to Netflix. I bought this because it sounded like it would be better than my Roku. I am not yet convinced it is, I know it is early in its release so, I will give the developer a little time to fix the problems. Main problem is lack of Prime videos and storage is limited so probably won't use it for games. I am on my second day of owning this box an already it is telling me there is a problem loading videos. The screen saver pictures are nice though. Also, we should be able to attach an external USB drive to download movies and music we buy. I have several movies we bought from Amazon but, they only allow downloading them to Windows PC. So Apple users are better served buying videos from ITunes until this policy changes.

It appears to be limited to Amazon content, at least for videos. I believe that they do include a third party service if you search for music.I am searching for House of Cards, Season 2, a Netflix original. I am a Netflix subscriber so I would expect the Netflix listing to be displayed but Fire TV only returns the show's Season 1 available for purchase at Amazon and does does not list Netflix at all. As a Netflix subscriber, I could watch both seasons 1 and 2 for free but, according to Fire TV's search, Season 2 doesn't exist and I'd have to pay 2.99 per episode if I wanted to watch Season 1.See how Roku's search (second half of video) correctly shows that Season 1 is available from Netflix, Amazon, MGo and Vudu and that I can gety get Season 2 from Netflix. It's also telling me (checkmarks) that I subscribe to 3 of the 4 services listed.It's up to everyone to weigh Amazon's faster and more convenient voice search feature that returns Amazon-only content vs. Roku's ability to find content across the channels/services it carries.REVIEW BEGINS HERE:As a current/former owner and user of streamers such as Roku 3, Roku Stick and Google's Chromecast and also streaming/gaming platforms such as PS3/PS4 and Xbox 360/One, I believe I can do a fair assessment on what Amazon's Fire streamer is about and how it compares with the alternatives. I rely on reviews to help me make informed and rational purchase decisions and, hopefully, my assessment of Amazon's Fire TV may help others decide whether this is what they need or want.BROAD ASSESSMENTThe Fire TV will have to find its place in a pretty crowded marketplace. From what I've experienced so far, due to its tight integration with the Fire HDX tablets and Amazon's own Instant Video service in search it should be a great pick for anyone who owns the Amazon tablet and already subscribes to Amazon's Prime. Its ability to play games and the ease of downloading them should also appeal to non-hard-core gamers. For everybody else, depending on one's specific needs and expectations, the Fire TV may or may not be the 'right' streamer to buy.As one who purchased Amazon's original Kindle Fire on day one and went through several generations of Amazon's Kindle reader I expect that Amazon's streamer will also evolve or grow overtime. Amazon will listen to 'us' and the next generation streamer will be a much more interesting, 'new and improved', more capable and better tuned to our needs and wants. Until then, I would say that the current Fire TV is a competent, Amazon-content-biased (through search) streamer with gaming capabilities, lacking some in content and showing some innovation on search (offset by its currently favoring Amazon's service) and the user interface in general. Parental controls and the games could make it a favorite streamer if young children are also watching. If all you want is streaming and don't care about casual gaming you may feel that you are paying for capabilities that you don't need.CONTENTThe Fire TV offers most but not all mainstream services and I suspect it covers what most of us will ever want to access and I am sure that more services will be added in time. However, at this time Amazon's selection pales when compared to Roku's 1000+ wildly diverse channels but the Rokus have been around for a while. All mainstream services now on Fire TV are also available on Roku, PS3/4, Xbox 360/One and many on Google's Chromecast.Fire TV attempts to be a little different when it comes to accessing content, allowing for voice search but results are currently returned mostly from Amazon's Instant Video. By comparison, Rokus offer text based cross-service search with results returned from most 'big' providers. Amazon's attempt to predict and preload what we are most likely to watch will have to be assessed over a longer period of time so, time will tell.The soon to be implemented parental controls should differentiate and distinguish Amazon's product from the competition once they are implemented.INNOVATIONAmazon's great innovative, revolutionary, disruptive device was the Kindle reader and the enhanced Kindle Paperwhite. I suspect that thousands of acres of trees are still known as 'forests' instead of 'recyclable material' these days because of the Kindle. Amazon's Fire tablets are nice but they are... tablets. The Fire TV streamer/gaming device falls probably under 'okay' or 'interesting' streamers and 'not too bad' gaming platforms.The quad-core CPU is also nice but, whether I'm streaming on a significantly more powerful PS4 or a tiny one-core CPU Chromecast, the video/audio quality seems to be comparable and practically indistinguishable. I assume that the reason for a more powerful CPU is the game-playing part.The lack of large permanent storage (HDD) implies that, as a gaming platform, the Fire TV will allow for mostly small to medium-size games with a lot of cloud interaction and storage. Again, a feature that may not be suitable for those whose ISPs charge by the Megabyte or impose a monthly download quota on their customers.Game playing on the Fire TV works but those used with big console's lag-free controllers that 'rumble', talk back and sense motion may not view the Fire TV as a serious gaming platform.I would say that Amazon's streamer is solidly in the mainstream as far as innovation. It's a quality product but not a revolutionary one and that's still Okay.VALUEThere's very little that Amazon's Fire TV does that other platforms don't do.- The PS3/4 and the Xbox 360/One are vastly superior gaming platforms and equally good streamers and multimedia machines. Only they are much larger physically and cost significantly more.- The Chromecast and the Rokus are a lot more innovative and allow for a lot more flexibility and integrate nicely with tablets and PCs and allow for streaming personal content without being limited to a specific brand or model of tablet. They are also somewhat more difficult to setup.- Small streamers such as the Roku Stick and the Chromecast are very portable as they fit into one's shirt pocket. Amazon's Fire TV could be carried around at least in theory but it's not as easy to move around.- Roku is still the leader of 'content' but Amazon's selection should cover what most of us want to watch most of the time.- The Fire TV costs a lot more than a Roku or a Chromecast but, even if a gaming controller is added, is still less than a PS3 or an Xbox 360- Voice search as implemented on Fire TV at the time I am writing this (restricted to Amazon and Vevo) is in effect hiding content from other services, potentially costing you money if one show is available to purchase or rent at Amazon but it may be also carried by another service you subscribe to as a 'free' stream.WHO NEEDS ITAnyone who already has one or more Roku, Chromecast or Xbox, Playstation in their homes probably don't need one at this time. Unless they are tightly integrated into Amazon's ecosystem or are cable cutters who wish some tighter controls over what their kids are watching.Those who are looking for their first streamer should consider- Fire TV's ease of use (beats the Chromecast but it's probably on par with Roku and the Xbox/Playstations)- Amazon's great user support- Roku's enormous channels selection- Playstation and Xbox being clearly superior gaming platforms (if you don't mind paying up to 60 for newly released games)- Amazon's attempt to keep their users confined to Amazon's own hardware platforms and content streams vs. Roku's and Chromecast relative openness- Fire TV's split gaming/streaming personality (Jack of 2 trades) vs. Roku's and Chromecast focus on streaming- Price, of courseIt's not an easy decision to make. I would be very happy with the Fire TV if it was the first streamer device in the house. With so many stream-capable and game-playing boxes/sticks already operating and doing well, I like Amazon's Fire TV for being a well designed, capable streamer with some nice extra capabilities but I also like and I've been using the Rokus for their huge number of channels and portability and great interface and the Chromecast for allowing me to easily send whatever is in my Chrome browser to the TV. I hope that Amazon's search will soon expand to cover non-Amazon services or it won't be a useful tool. I may not have the the Fire TV attached to the big TV in the living room but our daughter who happens to be a faithful Kindle and Amazon Prime user asked for it in her room.
This was easy to set up I can access many movies and purchase new releases without going out of the house to search for a video store. I can also access my Netflix I love this and wondered how I ever lived without it. Thank you Amazon
I noticed within a week that some movies I had watched in the past on PRIME for FREE are NO longer on the Free list. And where did all the Chick-Flick movies go we have to pay for each thing now still deciding if this is getting returned or not. The equipment is awesome and set up was fast and so so easy, but I didn't purchase it to PAY for each and everything I want to watch. I love Amazon and shop all the time, but .... why take the movies off the FREE list for PRIME
We love it. Bought one for family room and the office. Easy to install and use. LOVE all of the options for things to watch.
I just received my Fire TV box today, and it is everything promised and then some, imho. I've been exploring it (and got started on Fargo) for the last 3 hours and the menus are intuitive, the voice search is quite nice, and I love the way the remote feels in my hand. A value buy, in my opinion, especially if you are an amazon instant video subscriber. I haven't even explored all the other sources.
The Fire TV came well packaged with extremely simple instructions. Plug in the power cable and HDMI cable (not included), put batteries in the remote and that's it. After initial start up there is an update that must be run, but after a few minutes the unit was up and running. Interface is nice looking and easy to use. Voice search worked perfectly...it understood this Kentucky accent instantly. Flipping through the movie choices is super fast (almost too fast since it has skipped a movie a time or two). Netflix is on the home page, but you have to install the app before using it the first time. As I'm typing this review the unit is displaying some beautiful screensaver pictures while I have a movie paused. If you store your photos on Amazon's Cloud you can use your own pictures instead. Picture quality is fantastic and movies start up lightning fast. The only thing I see as a con would be how the Prime movies are marked. The placement of the Prime marker in the upper left of the movie icon is very small and isn't as prominent as it should be making it rather difficult to tell whether it's Prime or a movie you would rent/purchase. I figure in the days and weeks ahead Amazon will be listening to customer suggestions (as they usually do) and more and more updates will be forthcoming making this device even better. For me the Amazon Fire TV is a winner. It will definitely be replacing a Directv receiver I was using.Update: After one full day of using Amazon's Fire TV I am more than satisfied with my purchase.If you read reviews like I do make sure to skip over the ones that don't have the Amazon Verified Purchase listed under their name or click that their post is unhelpful. These are people who are trying to review a product without even having it in their possession. If you discount those reviews (which make the overall rating less than it should be) you will discover that the majority of people who actually purchased this product are very satisfied.4-6-14 Update: Added the AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable and this has added a whole new dimension to the sound quality of my tv. The sounds are more richer and louder than ever before. I am continually amazed at what this little device is capable of. I really suggest getting the cable I mentioned above to make your Fire TV experience even better4-8-14 Update: Turned on the device today and went to start up Netflix...all I got was a white screen. Turned the unit off and on, but still a white screen. I uninstalled the Netflix app and reinstalled and it worked again. I don't believe it was a problem on the device itself, but rather the app since all of the other apps worked fine.4-15-14 Update: Had the same white screen issue with Netflix some more. Contacted customer service and reported the issue. He stepped me through the process of going into the settings then the apps. When you come to Netflix instead of uninstalling click on force stop. This fixed the issue. If I have the problem again he asked that I contact them back immediately so that they can contact the developers with the issue. I continue to enjoy this device and have since gotten rid of the Directv receiver I had connected. I can't recommend the Fire TV enough6-25-14 Update: My Fire TV is still going strong and I am completely happy with it. I have found that I watch TV more so on The Fire than my DirecTV. The one thing I haven't checked (but will sometime) is the USB port. I've got to save some movies to my flash drive and see if I can play a saved movie from the drive using the USB port on The Fire. Finding Amazon content is a breeze using the Voice Search and searching through movies or videos using Netflix and others is fine. Yes, it would be great to be able to use the Voice Search with everything else, but it's not a deal breaker for me nor an inconvenience. I would imagine Amazon will eventually include their Voice Search on any third party application as time allows. Even after using it all this time I'm still amazed at the sound and picture quality of such a tiny device. For me Amazon just gets better and better.8-4-14 Update: I had movies saved to an external hard drive and I plugged it into the USB port on the Amazon Fire, unfortunately, it doesn't work. It basically did nothing. It made no noise like it was trying to access my hard drive nor did it recognize any USB plugged in. Hopefully Amazon will push out an update to fix this at some point and time. It would be a wonderful feature to have. (Hint, Hint...Amazon).
the voice recognition makes finding content so easy, even worked with hulu+I already had a mogo pro so I tried out the games and for a android console they are first ratefar better then oyua which i'm sorry to say i'll never use again.the tv and music content and menu's are very quick thanks to the very powerful hardware under the hoodoverall I'm positive that this unit will kill roku and apple tveven google chromecast better be careful (I own all these units so I speak from experience)
I assumed, based on the product description, that access to 40,000 Songs meant that I could play my own 2800 songs on the cloud that I also pay Amazon a couple hundred dollars a year for. Why not a cloud player app for crying out loud. If I'm mistaken and I CAN access my cloud music, I sure appreciate it if somebody could tell me how. That's why I bought it. I might return it because I can already get everything by Amazon's own content through other means. Kind of a drag that I can't play my AMAZON PURCHASED music through my expensive home theater. I couldn't care less about viewing my Amazon cloud photos on my home theater.
Amazing unit Easy to set up just remember to also purchases an hdmi to hdmi cord that does not come with the Amazon fire tv or you will have to wait to get started. This makes my tv look more crisp and clear than it ever has. Easy to use. Absolutely love it
I love the Amazon Fire TV but . . . (I considered giving it only 3 stars for the comments listed below, but I really like it)OK, after only owning the Amazon Fire TV since last Friday, April 4th, I suspected the limited 8GB of internal memory would be a problem and it is.As of last night, April 9th, my Fire TV internal storage was full. I was trying to install the Deus Ex game that is available for Fire TV and received that message that I needed to delete something. So, I started deleting a few games and finally had enough deleted that it started downloading again except I think it started all over again. About 90 of the way through downloading the 2ND TIME, I got the same message to delete some more. So, I deleted a few more games and then it took off downloading again from the beginning again Then, it completed the download and started installing the game and then I got the same message again for a 3RD TIME That made me say a few choice wordsAt that point, I said to heck with it and figured I'd wait to see if Amazon does anything about this. So, I spent 7 on a game I didn't get to play. See, the USB port isn't enabled so there is no support for external storage. From what I saw, the Fire TV App takes up 2.2 GB of the total 8GB available. Heck, The Walking Dead app alone is over 1GB in size. I can't verify this but I swear each time I was downloading Deus Ex it used up another 700+ MB of memory and when the download didn't complete I didn't get the storage back So, in (3) attempts to get it installed I swear I used up 2 to 3 GB of internal storage that is still gone. I was looking through all of the apps/games that I have installed and didn't add it up but I really don't have that much installed right now and it only looks like it amounts to 2 to 3GB but where the other 2 to 3GB is, is a mystery. I deleted like (8) total games with a couple of them in the 400 to 500MB range and never got Deus Ex installed.Amazon needs to get this fixed fast for anybody that purchased the Fire TV for any sort of Android gaming purposes. Just hope they fix it faster than OUYA did which took like 6 months plus to enable external storage.I would like to add, that it is a huge engineering oversight, in my opinion, to only give the Fire TV 8GB of internal store. Just enable the USB port to allow for external store I would gladly go out and buy a 15 32GB USB memory stick or even spend the 50 to 60 on a 500GB external hard drive.In this day and age, the Fire TV should come with at least 32GB of internal storage That would allow for at least the storage of (60) 500 MB game considering maybe 2GB would be used up for the Amazon Fire TV app. That would be reasonable and fair.Today, 2.2 GB is used for the Fire TV app leaving less than 6GB of internal store. Considering The Walking Dead is over 1GB just by itself, that leaves only 5GB left. What is left only allows for (10) more 500MB games. So, a system that only allows the installation of (10) to (12) games/apps at 500MB each clearly isn't big enough.
When my new Fire TV arrived today, I was cautiously optimistic. We have two Kindle Fires in the house, a 1st Gen and the previous Gen, and we love them. So here is my initial thoughts, I will update this review as time goes by.First impressions, as always Amazon does a great job on the packaging, and this box is actually a little more elegant than when we ordered our fist e-reader way back when. But it carries the glossy black look they used in the past now for the Fire tablets. The box was easy open and the device neatly tucked inside.Hook up was as easy as it gets, and connecting to my Wifi wasn't a problem. It did need a software update out of the box, which these days isnt uncommon. The problem here was I was already seeing an issue. It kept telling me my connection seemed slower than usually I needed to check it. Having the robust network we must have for a house full of online gamers I knew there could only be a couple of problems. My other devices were working fine on the network, but to alleviate any strain on it i disconnected them all and reset my connection at the modem and router. The download resumed, but still with the same message at the bottom. After about 30 or 45 minutes I finally got the introduction video.So, off and running, I go the app store to spend the coins I got for purchasing the additional controller, see this reveiw, http://www.amazon.com/review/RGDZLYOUBIDI6/refcmcrrdpperm . While trying to download a handful of games, which it ques nicely to keep from over working its self, I ran into these problems. - the interface was slow load images for the apps I was looking at, and somtimes refused to populate the list I was trying to view - it also would randomly disconnect from the network. This points to a connection issue that i stated earlier. But now I am convinced it is the Wifi radio in the device. I have had gaming systems and streaming devices in this room before and never experienced this issue. This could also be what was causing the previously stated issue with the menus. - there is no way to force sleep the unit or turn it off.So, I proceed to call tech support. The guy on the phone was really nice and tried to be helpful, but he had no training on the device other than what little he had played around with his. He says, the device will eventually go to sleep, but isnt sure of how long it will take. As far as the wifi goes he suggested doing everything I had already done, except for unpluggin the device for about 3 seconds or so. So I try this, he has me stream something from Prime, which works great, but as soon as i start to download something again, the connection is lost. The phone call ends up being a waste of time. At this point I am disappointed. I know this is a new device and will have issues, but the Wifi this is proven tech it should work.Pros:Beautiful minimalist designease of setupsmall foot printgames look great, once you get them to workCons:Customer service wasn't trained on trouble shootingWifi connectivity sporadicNo way to force sleep or power down deviceIn the end, it could be a great product. I am going to give it some time and see if another software update might be on the way, or if maybe something was wrong with my network yesterday. I will update soon.**********Update 04/07/14:After a full weekend of putting the Fire TV through the paces I have updated my initial 2 star rating to a four. Here are the reasons why.The network issue appears to be just that, a network issue. Whether it was on my end or because of it being the first full day of release I do not know. But I did not have the connection issue again all weekend. Seeing as this was the biggest reason for my 2 star rating, I have changed that.As far as the auto sleep mode, for those that like to be able to control when something is on, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The Fire is very fickle about this. But as someone pointed out in the comments and I do agree with them, it is a very minimal power draw and as along as you don't leave your TV on it shouldn't affect anything.The few games I played were good as far as casual gaming goes. No buggy or jerky movements. But you must remember, this is for casual gaming. You are not going to console quality out of this.Hope this all helps.
It was time for me to upgrade my Roku 2XS and after looking at the Roku 3 and the Amazon Fire TV I decided to go with the Fire TV. I don't use a lot of the private channels on Roku and the only thing I saw missing that I have on Roku is Spotify and I'll work around that. The main reason I decide to go for the Fire TV over the Roku was the gaming feature. I'm not a heavy gamer but having a device that allowed me to play games with a real game pad for only 99 sounded appealing. I'll break my review into sections so others can quick reference it. I'll say now this got 2 stars because it is FAST and because, if you don't mind getting Amazon VOD stuffed down your throat there is some good content.- SETUPInitial boot up was easy, plug in and go and it autoplays a simple intro video. However, I immediately had issues setting up both Plex and Netflix, Netflix still will not work. I get what looks like computer code with the message error forwarding request to origin On Plex and Hulu+ there is a high pitched, metallic echo with all audio and on Hulu+ I occasionally get a pink/lavender screen with audio but no video. Some internet searching suggested this had to do with a handshake issue and that rebooting should fix it, it didn't. However when I plugged my old Roku back in it worked fine.- NAVIGATION and SEARCH (text and voice)The Fire TV is very, very, very Amazon VOD centered. Most of your navigation data from the main menu pushes you to Amazon movies, TV or apps/games. All other channels reside under the Apps column. As far as I can tell, the voice search only searches Amazon content. This really bothers me as none of the videos, web ads, write ups, etc. mentions this. They brag how they have all your favorite content from Hulu+, Netflix, Crackle, Plex but fail to mention that you cannot search those other apps/channels. BIG turn-off for me. Once inside the other channels navigating and searching works just like the Roku... clicking around with the little remote. The more I think about it the more it annoys me because Amazon advertising made such a big deal out of the voice search and how no one liked clicking around with the remote.- WATCHING TV/MOVIESDon't know. My audio was too awful to watch anything. Never made it to a single show. I tried changing the settings but that didn't do any good. EVERY program has a high-pitched echo on it. However it doesn't have the audio issues when playing games so no idea what the issue is.- PLAYING GAMESTBD. I've played a couple games of Asphalt 8 with the remote and it was pretty cool, but a race car game on a remote is a bit tedious. They show out of stock on the Amazon game controller and it looks like they pulled the Nyko due to poor performance. I'd like to get the controller and see what it's like. If the games are still decent I might swap out the unit and see if that fixes my sound/video issues.- OVERALL IMPRESSIONI do not like the Amazon Fire TV and I'm displeased with Amazon for it. I've always trusted Amazon as a company, and they've always taken care of me before, but I feel like they pushed a lot of smoke and mirrors to sell this device. I'm torn between trying to get it to work and just returning it and getting a Roku.
Here goes, I'm the 9 thousandth reviewer for this product LOL. short preface: I love Amazon, so when comparing all streaming devices in the end I went with the Fire TV because of the outstanding customer service, and it will improve with time. That being said, I share the frustrations that all my fellow buyers have: I hate not being able to sort out the non Prime videos, I truly dislike paying for an episode (I didn't see that one coming, even though I did a ton of research). But overall I love my new cable bill, which only includes internet and basic, and I mean basic, service (15.00) because I'm reserving the right to order HBO and Showtime at some point. Was massively disappointed in Hulu Plus, because they don't offer the entire series in a show anymore (did they run out of server space or what) Netflix was a pleasant surprise. In case you are wondering, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Prime are your alternatives to paying your cable bill. And streaming is quite alright...after you get over the initial shock of not having live TV, although, ABC does do live TV hope the other stations follow suit soon. Overall, as a non tech person, it was ridiculously easy to hook this up, really anyone can do it. And like I said, if you're comparing other products, in the end Amazon cannot be beat for customer service or support.
Ok first off, if you are looking to get one of these things dont put all your eggs on one basket as far as other reviewers go. The bad ones I think are just haters, apple lovers, people who dont have one, or have nothing better to do but to not give thing a proper review.I got mine yesterday and had a few hours to play with it and use it. I have XBox 360 and used that for my Netflix and Amazon Prime but wanted something else to do that with. So Amazon came out with this and ordered it. Here is a list of good and bad. But understand I dont own apple or Roku.The Good:1. The speed and response on this thing is VERY VERY fast.2. The video quality is great. It truly is 1080p. I think that is better the what my XBox puts out3. The sound quality is great. I used a HDMI plugged it in to my 5.1 and sounds great.4. The hook up was very easy and straight forward. It is a plug and play.5. Hooking up to home network was very simple. I use the wireless and it so far runs flawlessly.6. The remote is small and very simple and not complicated very straight forward and very smooth.7. The movie and show load up time is very instant. With my Netflix it took no time at all to load up unlike my Xbox.8. This is the best part I thing anyway and so far no has said anything about this is...That you can take it with you on a trip. As long as the T.V has a HDMI and you can get on the wireless you can watch your programs or movies on any T.V. I think that is the best part about it all.9. It is small and very light.10. The voice search works really well.Cons and these may not be cons or bad for you.1. The voice search will only find movies or programs on Amazon Prime. But from what I hear that is cause of a deal thing with the other providers and that may change in the further.2. You can not power it down or put it to sleep. But for me that is no big deal. And really you can just unplug it if you want.Summery:Over all I find this unit works really well and it is very responsive. I have yet to see any lag with the things that I have watched or played with.Note: I have not used the games for this so this is only for the programs. I put it through its paces for the few hours that I have used it and so far I think that Amazon did a pretty good job with this.Note: After looking at the box and reading the back of the box there is a note that says there will be a Spring 2014 update. So my thinking is that the stuff that is missing or things that are not there will be coming soon. Just remember that this JUST came out a few days ago and I am sure that things will only get better in time.
I bought it to run XBMC, and it works great. I had no experience loading custom apps on Android boxes, but had XBMC running in about 5 minutes. It runs all my videos well. All the other Amazon functionality is a nice bonus. All in all very happy.
ok, i'm not going to lie, this thing as the fastest setup. i thought i was seeing things when i turned it on for the first time. apparently this device is connected to your amazon prime account so once you turn it on, it automatically literally goes straight to your prime account without signing in. i seriously had to call customer service because i was really creeped out on if i signed in or not. anyway, this thing is way better than the roku. though i do wish they had a iphone app for it because the remote is so small and i tend to lose it alot. its pretty much the same formate on the roku when it comes to Netflix and Hulu. it goes to the next episode atomically like samsung smart tv and the roku but i guess its a common thing but amazon prime you have to select the next episode itself. i seem to see this in a lot of other streaming devices.

I am in south America and heare docen't work like Apple TVApple TV is very easy, you see everything in one page.The Amazon fire Tv control is very nice.
It will not store my netflix sign in so I need to sign in every time. I do not like it.
When you add the MLB and PBS aps I will switch from Roku......Roku customer service is terrible and they dont seem to care if you're happy with their product or not.
Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Update 7/21/2014:The latest software upgrade as significantly improved the device for Amazon Prime members - addressing most of my original complaints.Now that there is an entire section dedicated to Prime content, it is much easier to find things without having to wade through pay to view content. I wouldn't mind seeing more 'categories' to search through, but don't want to diminish the improvement.It's still not possible to search and return only Prime content. I think it should be possible to tell the device (when you search) that you only want returns from what is available for free to Prime members.The new 'Music' option looks intriguing but seems to have no purpose at this point. Not sure why it was added, but I hope it grows into a useful feature given the new Prime Music package.I would also like to see some sort of DLNA feature added. As one who rips all content that I buy (blu rays, dvds, cds) to a computer on my Network, I would very much like to be able to stream this material to the FireTV. Adding support for a connected USB device is not a solution for me. I have no intention of keeping two copies of all this material. Read more
Amazing the best Amazon purchases EVER If you don't have one get one, really right now go do it you won't be sorry
Bought my Amazon Fire to take better advantage of Prime video and my wife's Netflix account. It's great Easy to set up, the voice search works really well. Love the simplicity and for us it was the perfect way to add streaming media to our main TV.
Many shows that are available on Hulu Plus website are not available on Amazon Fire TV Hulu Plus app. A message says that this show can only be viewed at hulu.com. Very disappointing. Example: Days of Our Lives.
I collect these streaming boxes, anything from Google Chromecast to Dlink Boxee Box, Boxee TV etc. This Amazon Fire TV has been my go to device since it arrived.The menu could use some work, but it's most likely because I'm used to Apple TV and my iOS environment.The responsiveness is top notch. My favorite feature is the voice control, built right into the remote.I would only ask for one additional feature, the ability to plug headphones into the remote and listen silently.
I LOVE THE FIRE TV. IT IS JUST FANTASTIC. I AM NOW NOW WATCHING MY ULTRAVIOLET COLLECTION WITH FLIXSTER APP FROM FIRE TV AND PLAYS ABSOLUTLELY FANTASTIC.
This is without a doubt one of the best purchases that I have made on Amazon. below is a breakdown.Pros:Setup up is easyBluetooth Remote works all over the house so I can voice search upstairs and have the video ready to play when I get to itVoice search REALLY DOES WORKRemote and Box are SUPER fastCons:Setup takes a while (even though it is easy)I did not know my voice searches were recorded until I was looking around in my device area on amazon.com/manageyourkindleRemote seems to use a lot of power, I replaced batteries after first month due to slower response time
Just setup my new FireTV ordered via my Amazon account and so far so good so fast. Setup time: 10 minutes.The good:1. NO setup to access Amazon content.I am already a Prime member so once I had my wifi setup the FireTV did a quick scan of the internet for updates before running the tutorial video. To my surprise once the tutorial was completed I was welcomed by web my Amazon username (Hello insert name)complete with my Watch List and Video Library. No additional steps needed to access my content. Cool and creepy at the same time. But, who am I kidding my electronic footprint is large.2. Super fast. The FireTV interface (content menu system) is quick and straightforward. It's a better faster interface than any of my other devices I own that streams Amazon content (PS3, XBOX deprecated, iPad, Vizio SmartTV, and wifi enabled BD player). I do not have a Netflix membership so I haven't tried it yet (Maybe there's a free trial attached, but will Amazon allow that). I played a movie out of my Amazon Video Library and it started instantly. Missing is the your content is still loading delay. I am telling you the movie started immediately.3. PRIME content. I read some comments that stated posters had trouble being able to easily identify PRIME content. I am not having the same problem. All PRIME content displays the blue PRIME banner in the upper left hand corner as it does on all the other devices mentioned above. So maybe there has been a software update since. Which means Amazon heard you.4. Power. I was concerned over the lack of a power button on the remote or FireTV unit itself which I thought meant the device would have to be manually disconnected from the power source. NOT SO The device goes to sleep (no power LED activity) after a set period of time and is easily awaken by the press of a button on the remote. Perfect.The bad:1. Haven't found it yet.
The product is user friendly, easy to hook up and a great deal for the price. I would recommend you give it a chance. Easy to compare to the competitor's product.
My Amazon Prime movies come in crystal clear and fast.The Voice Search really WORKS very wellMy Netflix resolution is excellent, much better than what the Netflix app on my LG flatscreen TV delivers.The Plex app delivers excellent video (I haven't tried the music yet).Having used this for a little over a week now my next step is to buy two more for each TV in the house and give away my Apple TV. It simply does everything so much better.Most Satisfied Highly recommendI will post an update if I have anything further to add but I will say this: Go get One - Really Worth The Price
Received my Amazon Fire TV 2 weeks ago. It works good very responsive with quad core but the interface seems very limited on apps the main ones are there Amazon of course, Net Flix, and a must have PLEX. but missing a lot of others, Still like ROKU 3 as a main streaming unit a little slower but chucked full of apps. Amazon needs to get with it if they are going to lead the pack here. also the speech search is not useable with Net Flix or any of the other apps only works with amazon. this is definitely loaded heavy on the amazon side, It makes no sense to have a great feature that cant work with the whole package.I would recommend to others but tell them of the draw backs so they know what they are getting in to here.Great product but needs some one to help it along.
First I would like to say that I am coming from using Google TV. Fire TV is a great device. The voice search is accurate at picking up what I say. My biggest problem with this device is also with the voice search. Coming from Google TV if you used the search feature if would look for it in more places. Lets say I am searching for the movie Gremlins. On Google TV it would look for it in Netflix, Amazon Instant, instant prime, Google play store, HBO Go, and you get the idea. This device for example will not check Netflix. So I must do a voice search to see if it is on Amazon, if not I must open lets say Netflix and use the up, down, left, right buttons and manually enter the letter to find out if it is on Netflix. That was the big issue for me. A small issue is the amount of apps. No HBO Go, Google play store, and others. I am not blaming amazon for this. It is an open system so HBO and others just need to make the apps for it. This devise is quick, and amazon items start up instantly, but not Netflix. Netflix must load first, but that is not a big deal. If you are wondering why I am switching from Google TV, it is because Google neglected it and it hasn't received updates in a long time. I think Google gave up on it.
I own a roku and apple tv and have to say that the Amazon Fire TV falls into more of the apple tv category. It's definitely a walled garden of content that feeds you into amazon's prime tv offerings. You can access a lot of titles there for pay and often less expensively than On Demand options available from your cable provider.However, for your prime investment, there are no free titles. I'd love to see Amazon take a netflix model for a certain number of older titles. The price barrier keeps me from watching older titles, but the prices of latest releases are about average and worth it.The interface is great. I find the voice activation to be really accurate and easy to use. It's really how you are meant to navigate the massive number of options available.Performance is best in class as the Fire TV has a quad core processor that is unmatched by any other provider. I'd love to see a great game title arrive on the box that would make the game controller worth the investment. However, for an all-in-one, solution the game selection can definitely hit the spot.I use the plex and netflix apps available for this device and they perform great. Certainly, there's no blu-ray player that can match the capability of this device.All-in-all I definitely recommend this device to anyone, but still prefer the Roku since Roku isn't selling its own content service, so it agnostically serves a lot of free content that you didn't even know existed.
I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes. Normally you pay 150-400+ extra for features that are found in these 100 boxes. I have not found a smart tv that is decent and is also a good value for what you are getting. The advantage is that you can use your TV remote to access the content. (and that is about it)HTPC: These are desktop computers or Mac Minis or Android Sticks that you load software on to stream video to your TV. These can add content that no normal streaming box can access, without giving up quality but they are only recommended for something comfortable with technology that doesn't mind fixing the issues that come up from time to time.Video Game Consoles: Xbox/Playstations can access some of the content that streaming boxes do and have plenty of power to deliver the streams. The downside is the cost (unless you already have one) and the interfaces. These consoles are not designed to stream video exclusively so the interfaces are decent but can be clunky.(You can use other options but frankly they aren't worth the hassle for the amount of hair pulling you would do.)Now this Amazon product has changed everything. It might not be the box for you...but honestly there is a good chance that it SHOULD BE. This is a brand new category for Amazon and they got a lot right, but there are a few shortcomings (at least at launch) as well so read all of this to see what those are.Amazon's Fire TV boxPros:+ Nothing else is this fast. While Roku 3 impressed the world, this raises the bar dramatically. With a quad core processor and 4 times the memory of any other streaming product, it speeds through menus, boots quicker, starts videos quicker and honestly has the muscle to not struggle with higher end resolutions and surround sound like other boxes can do at times. The best way I can explain it, you will have extra hours at the end of the year because this box is THAT much faster.+ Voice search is amazing. It really works. Less using a four directional keypad to enter in titles is a real time saver and makes you wonder why this wasn't done before but it is only for Amazon content and VEVO (music videos) (at least for now). You can not use the voice search with Netflix for example.+ Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another 40. The 40 gaming controller feels a bit pricy for this type of gaming and really should be 25 or less in my opinion. That being said, this box has real games you would actually want to play instead of a VERY limited selection on Roku 3 but it is not a REAL console at 100 and honestly shouldn't be compared to them.+ Better image quality I know you are thinking I am imagining things or have changed my setup but both myself and my wife have noticed that generally (in different apps) the video is slightly sharper and clearer. We are using the exact same tv, settings, even the same HDMI cable that we used with the Roku 3 until we switched it for the Fire TV box. We have noticed that especially on poor quality feeds that the image quality is noticeably better than under the same feeds with Roku 3. Now I don't know if there is better graphic chips or if the bigger processor can do more tweaking while streaming but it seems to be something. As image quality is a huge deal for most folks (and normally us streamers have to suffer with decent quality) this is certainly worth noting. So far we have noticed this under Netflix, VEVO and Plex.Cons:- It lacks soul. Yes, soul. The Fire TV box and remote are built like a dvd player or appliance--cold, fast, efficient. Unlike Roku 3 where the box seems to have a bit of the personally of TiVo--it feels warmer, more inviting. Everything about this box is business like, including the interface and the lack of options to change it.- The interface is more than merely cold. It is simply less flashy/pretty than the Roku 3 interface. While fast, I am less tempted to wander around like I do on Roku 3. It seems like they are being pretty dependent on the voice search function which is great but it leaves you missing out on the random items you find along the way with the Roku 3 interface. I will update this more upon extended use.- The voice search only works for Amazon's own content (and VEVO) and not most 3rd party channels like Netflix.- The remote is not ready for gaming use, compared to the Roku 3 remote with gaming buttons when you turn the remote sideways and more sensors for detecting movements/motion.- Another feature about the remote I don't care for is the use of Bluetooth instead of WIFI. Roku used to use Bluetooth on their former high end box but instead replaced it with wifi to increase battery life and to add the headphone jack in the remote. It will likely take a few weeks of use to report battery life but this has me concerned.- No headphone jack function like Roku 3. Now to be honest, if you use that on the Roku 3 it can be a battery drain but it is a cool feature.- Missing some popular channels at launch. There is no HBO-Go, no M-Go and no Vudu. In addition, the channel count is much less than Roku's at launch.- Channels operate differently on FireTV than the do on Roku 3. See my notes below for more information.Overall:This Fire TV box took so much from other company's products with only a few missing items. They focused on delivering smooth, fast performance with less frills than Roku 3 for the same price. While there are missing channels and features, the biggest failure for me PERSONALLY is the cost of the gaming controller. Without it, this box isn't ready for gaming but adding 40 more for the ability to try out the functionality seems pretty steep. Had Amazon included it with every Fire TV box, they would have sold a lot more games and had everyone calling the Roku 3 a poor value.If you do not have any streaming box yet, I would HIGHLY recommend this box over every other product on the market right now. I don't make this endorsement lightly. I currently own 3 Roku 3 boxes because I liked them so much, until I used this Fire TV box. This box means Roku will have to really work on improving their product for Roku 4 or they will lose the high end market. (An update, my wife officially asked to replace the Roku 3 boxes with more Fire TV boxes tonight. Yes, these things are that good folks)If you have a Roku 3 box, really look at the missing channels and features--are they something you could give up for faster performance (Also look at my notes on the features of the various common apps.) If the answer is yes, then grab one of these and try it. If no, wait to see if Amazon adds features/channels. At the very least, consider an Fire TV box for your next box.I do not personally recommend Apple TV as they are still too slow and lack too many features and functions. Apple keeps promising something amazing but delivering minor improvements.If you are on a budget and have an Android based tablet, consider Chromecast. It is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to Roku 3 Fire TV.I am giving this box a 4.8 rating, compared to a 4.2 for Roku 3.I will update this review regularly for a while, so check back for more information Also if you have questions or comments, please feel free to ask them in the comments section. Either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them.UPDATE 1:Based on comments, I wanted to add a few points.Regarding comments that I received the item free or are paid by Amazon to write this review, etc.I paid the full list price and local sales tax for this box (grrr). Nothing was provided to me nor was I paid anything to write about this device. I do not work for Amazon, I own my own company. For this item, I am just a customer. In fact, I didn't expect to even purchase a Fire TV prior to it being announced because I figured it would only deal with Amazon's own content which I feel is much weaker than Netflix. In fact, I have talked two different family members into getting Netflix over Amazon's Prime Streaming service in the past month alone.HBO Go:This has been repeated over and over in the comments but HBO Go support for me is not something I am interested in as I do not have cable service anymore nor do I feel that HBO is a better value than Netflix. I would not go without Netflix support at all but I personally think HBO Go is more niche for many people and honestly I bet this device will get that channel before too long. Clearly the HBO Go people seem to be pushing the issue but I know 11 streaming box users and none use HBO Go so while I noted the missing feature above, people still seem to want to beat me up over it.UPDATE 2:CHANNELS:It needs to be said that some channels require cable/satellite subscriptions (to those channels) like HBO Go (not currently on this box), Showtime, ESPN, etc. Even if you have HBO, it does not mean that your provider allows the HBO Go, so look into that before purchasing any box with that in mind. I do like the Bloomberg TV (not available on Roku 3) App which actually features a LIVE TV feature.NETFLIX APP: Is the older style with the tall covers (like VHS boxes) instead of the new Netflix interface that uses short wide covers (like on Roku 3). Netflix has said they are moving everything to the new software but the Fire TV box doesn't have it yet. That makes comparing performance harder from Roku 3 to Fire TV. On my ISP provider Comcast (Netflix recently agreed to pay Comcast so they have faster streams to customers) I do not see a HUGE improvement in performance in buffing like you see on other channels. What it does seem to do is start in better quality and/or speed the improvement in quality. My guess is that the Netflix app needs to be tweaked to maximize the performance of this hardware. One positive with the FireTV app is that it plays the entire TV episode BEFORE switching to a small window with the countdown starting for the next episode. I can't tell you how many times I had to click, click, click and click just to see the end of an episode under Roku 3.Also, the FireTV Netflix app has two features that were removed from the updated Roku app. Before going into a TV show, FireTV tells you how many total episodes that Netflix has. On the Roku it shows you the number of seasons instead. I personally prefer the number of episodes but clearly that is a personal preference. Another point worth mentioning is that the FireTV Netflix App shows you how many items you have in your list and what item number you are on. That information is missing from the Roku 3 Netflix app.AMAZON PRIME CONTENT: Does not loop--a feature they should add (and likely will). This means once you get to the end, it just stops instead of keeping going.VOICE SEARCH:Voice search DOES cover some 3rd party content, despite everyone reporting it works on Amazon's content only. I have repeated confirmed it supports the VEVO app and will find music videos in that app. That may mean that other 3rd party apps are covered as well, or certainly might be able to be in the future. If you search for something that has PRIME content and VEVO content, it will default to the option with the most options. To switch to the other, simply arrow up and either left or right to see the music videos or PRIME search results.OPTICAL OUT:I noticed this box featured an optical out port but normally run everything through my LG TV (via HDMI) and then use an optical out to my receiver (so I never have to change the receiver's settings) so I wasn't excited about this addition to the Fire TV box over my Roku 3 boxes. I stand corrected. I decided to run my audio via the optical cable into the receiver directly from this Fire TV box (something that I can not do with Roku 3) and it fixed all random lip-sync issues I have from time to time on the Roku 3 box (and the same with the HDMI output on this box).Now I know this is not a typical setup for many people but I do know that tons of people have lip-sync issues with HDMI connections so being able to bypass the HDMI minefield is much more important than I expected.VEVO APP:This app works better than the Roku 3 app performance wise...one quick example is that some content simply fails on the Roku 3 app--try watching Britney Spears's Work B**CH (don't make fun of me). Vevo can play this video fine on YouTube and on the Fire TV app but struggles on Roku 3's app. SOME of VEVO's content is also available via VOICE SEARCH too.REMOTE:I do miss the jump back button on the remote that Roku 3 features. It is a tiny thing but it once you are used to jumping back to see that painting in the background or catch that line that you didn't hear because the phone rang, or someone was talking, you feel lost without it. UPDATE They did include this feature but hid it abit. You simply double click the reward button to skip back. I haven't seen anyone else mention this tip so you saw it here first peopleI do like that the enter button is back in the center of the directional keys. This is the way it used to be on Roku boxes before someone at Roku decided to move it below the directional keys, so you have to move your thumb oddly to press it.MULTITASKING:What multitasking you ask Since you haven't seen this advertised or mentioned elsewhere, I can understand your confusion but try this: Load a Pandora stream...then click on the HOME button and browse for movies/tv you want to watch. As long as you are in the Home/Amazon Prime content, you can browse WHILE Pandora continues playing. Now Pandora dies when you enter another APP like Netflix but it shows you that Multitasking is built into the operating system and may be utilized in future features. (Again, this TIP is only found here)Another update: This tip also works when browsing PLEX content before you play something. So even when utilizing a 3rd party app, it can keep going. When it changes to a new song, a small window pops up on the lower right hand side of the screen to tell you know the new song title and artist.PLEX APP:Compared to the Roku app, PLEX for FireTV is totally different. There are some cool features, like the backgrounds, the screensaver using your photos and the MUCH faster menuing (night and day from Roku 3) but I do miss the channels not requiring a couple clicks to switch to ONLINE to see. I do miss that clicking the play button doesn't play a clip, instead you select it (click) and then play it (second click).SCREENSAVER:FireTV has a screensaver that is honestly pretty cool in my opinion. I am not saying you can't do this with other boxes but no other box comes set up to display random photos (and includes a decent amount of beautiful photos as well.) This functionality covers 3rd party apps like Netflix and Plex too so you have a seamless slideshow no matter what you are using when it starts. This is the sort of thing you see on PCs not streaming boxes and it is a nice touch.GAME CHANGING:Many commenters have argued that this device is not gaming changing and many have rating my review not helpful because of that title.I said Nothing else is this fast to which one commenter said, Nobody cares how fast an streaming box is. That's not a game changerActually using it you will see what I mean. This is the first time a company has put so much into creating a very solidly made hardware device. Like a fast computer (which this basically is), it will depend on software that is written for it to fully show off its abilities.When AMD created their first processor that competed directly with Intel's higher end processors, it was a game changer, correct, because it changed the landscape of personal computers forever, lowered pricing, etc.People will look back in 5 years at this moment and say Amazon's FireTV changed how consumer streaming video boxes were made (instead of barely enough processing power to stream, they became able to compete with HTPCs and Mac Minis). This is the beginning of a new generation of streaming boxes.I said Voice search is amazing. and they said Not unique, by any means. My xbox, ps3, tablets, all have this, and all work amazingly.Find one person who owns this that doesn't say this voice search works better than anything from Google, Apple or Microsoft. The fact that little old Amazon could out deliver those tech giants is SHOCKING. The fact this works via a tiny remote makes it very easy to get use to. There is no other product in this price range that does this and no other streaming box even offers it at any cost.I said Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another 40 to which they said: And stick to basic android games. No thanks. I have a REAL console (or a couple of them) that can play REAL games...This isn't meant to compete with more expensive game consoles. It is meant to bring gaming to streaming boxes, just like tablets/cellphones have brought gaming to millions. They have not replaced gaming consoles (and likely never will) just like this box will not have you ditch your gaming console either but instead it opens you up to tons of games you CAN'T play on that same console. Just imagine all the cheap under 5/free games you can enjoy on your FireTV box. As I said above in my main review, I think Amazon really should have thrown in the controller to really get peopling playing the games but I can understand why they needed to limit their losses.Again, this is a best in class hardware device with real gaming and the best voice search on any tech device (and the only one for a streaming video box). Every future streaming box will be measured against this one. Tell me how that isn't game changingPlease understand that everyone has different priorities and requirements so no one box is going to be perfect for everyone. I am attempting to do my best to address most of the many options and provide a decently balanced opinion of them.Hopefully this review has been helpful to you.

I already have 2 Roku devices, but thought I would give this new Amazon device a try. This device works fine for the Amazon Instant video app, but there is a terrible lag in the video on the Netflix app that makes it unusable on this device. I know this issue is not my internet connection as the Netflix app works great on the Roku devices. In addition, the user interface on this device is generally just not that great. Wish I could get a refund and get another roku box.
I recently received my Amazon Fire TV after months of researching which streaming device would be the best. Basically what you are paying for is the internal specs, which Amazon has every other device beat by far. The software limitations I am confident will be resolved soon, like HBOGo and Amazon MP3 apps being added. We got this device to replace cable/dish. With subscriptions to Netflix DVDs, Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus, there is very little we are missing by streaming and much we are saving The folks complaining about Hulu stopping in the middle of programming, I have had this happen here and there, but it has been at peak Internet use times only. During the day, when folks are at work, I have had 0 problems streaming. Just make sure you have good, high speed internet and a cable modem router that can fully support the number of devices being used at one time. I am totally happy with our purchase of the Amazon FireTV
Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.
I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes. Normally you pay 150-400+ extra for features that are found in these 100 boxes. I have not found a smart tv that is decent and is also a good value for what you are getting. The advantage is that you can use your TV remote to access the content. (and that is about it)HTPC: These are desktop computers or Mac Minis or Android Sticks that you load software on to stream video to your TV. These can add content that no normal streaming box can access, without giving up quality but they are only recommended for something comfortable with technology that doesn't mind fixing the issues that come up from time to time.Video Game Consoles: Xbox/Playstations can access some of the content that streaming boxes do and have plenty of power to deliver the streams. The downside is the cost (unless you already have one) and the interfaces. These consoles are not designed to stream video exclusively so the interfaces are decent but can be clunky.(You can use other options but frankly they aren't worth the hassle for the amount of hair pulling you would do.)Now this Amazon product has changed everything. It might not be the box for you...but honestly there is a good chance that it SHOULD BE. This is a brand new category for Amazon and they got a lot right, but there are a few shortcomings (at least at launch) as well so read all of this to see what those are.Amazon's Fire TV boxPros:+ Nothing else is this fast. While Roku 3 impressed the world, this raises the bar dramatically. With a quad core processor and 4 times the memory of any other streaming product, it speeds through menus, boots quicker, starts videos quicker and honestly has the muscle to not struggle with higher end resolutions and surround sound like other boxes can do at times. The best way I can explain it, you will have extra hours at the end of the year because this box is THAT much faster.+ Voice search is amazing. It really works. Less using a four directional keypad to enter in titles is a real time saver and makes you wonder why this wasn't done before but it is only for Amazon content and VEVO (music videos) (at least for now). You can not use the voice search with Netflix for example.+ Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another 40. The 40 gaming controller feels a bit pricy for this type of gaming and really should be 25 or less in my opinion. That being said, this box has real games you would actually want to play instead of a VERY limited selection on Roku 3 but it is not a REAL console at 100 and honestly shouldn't be compared to them.+ Better image quality I know you are thinking I am imagining things or have changed my setup but both myself and my wife have noticed that generally (in different apps) the video is slightly sharper and clearer. We are using the exact same tv, settings, even the same HDMI cable that we used with the Roku 3 until we switched it for the Fire TV box. We have noticed that especially on poor quality feeds that the image quality is noticeably better than under the same feeds with Roku 3. Now I don't know if there is better graphic chips or if the bigger processor can do more tweaking while streaming but it seems to be something. As image quality is a huge deal for most folks (and normally us streamers have to suffer with decent quality) this is certainly worth noting. So far we have noticed this under Netflix, VEVO and Plex.Cons:- It lacks soul. Yes, soul. The Fire TV box and remote are built like a dvd player or appliance--cold, fast, efficient. Unlike Roku 3 where the box seems to have a bit of the personally of TiVo--it feels warmer, more inviting. Everything about this box is business like, including the interface and the lack of options to change it.- The interface is more than merely cold. It is simply less flashy/pretty than the Roku 3 interface. While fast, I am less tempted to wander around like I do on Roku 3. It seems like they are being pretty dependent on the voice search function which is great but it leaves you missing out on the random items you find along the way with the Roku 3 interface. I will update this more upon extended use.- The voice search only works for Amazon's own content (and VEVO) and not most 3rd party channels like Netflix.- The remote is not ready for gaming use, compared to the Roku 3 remote with gaming buttons when you turn the remote sideways and more sensors for detecting movements/motion.- Another feature about the remote I don't care for is the use of Bluetooth instead of WIFI. Roku used to use Bluetooth on their former high end box but instead replaced it with wifi to increase battery life and to add the headphone jack in the remote. It will likely take a few weeks of use to report battery life but this has me concerned.- No headphone jack function like Roku 3. Now to be honest, if you use that on the Roku 3 it can be a battery drain but it is a cool feature.- Missing some popular channels at launch. There is no HBO-Go, no M-Go and no Vudu. In addition, the channel count is much less than Roku's at launch.- Channels operate differently on FireTV than the do on Roku 3. See my notes below for more information.Overall:This Fire TV box took so much from other company's products with only a few missing items. They focused on delivering smooth, fast performance with less frills than Roku 3 for the same price. While there are missing channels and features, the biggest failure for me PERSONALLY is the cost of the gaming controller. Without it, this box isn't ready for gaming but adding 40 more for the ability to try out the functionality seems pretty steep. Had Amazon included it with every Fire TV box, they would have sold a lot more games and had everyone calling the Roku 3 a poor value.If you do not have any streaming box yet, I would HIGHLY recommend this box over every other product on the market right now. I don't make this endorsement lightly. I currently own 3 Roku 3 boxes because I liked them so much, until I used this Fire TV box. This box means Roku will have to really work on improving their product for Roku 4 or they will lose the high end market. (An update, my wife officially asked to replace the Roku 3 boxes with more Fire TV boxes tonight. Yes, these things are that good folks)If you have a Roku 3 box, really look at the missing channels and features--are they something you could give up for faster performance (Also look at my notes on the features of the various common apps.) If the answer is yes, then grab one of these and try it. If no, wait to see if Amazon adds features/channels. At the very least, consider an Fire TV box for your next box.I do not personally recommend Apple TV as they are still too slow and lack too many features and functions. Apple keeps promising something amazing but delivering minor improvements.If you are on a budget and have an Android based tablet, consider Chromecast. It is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to Roku 3 Fire TV.I am giving this box a 4.8 rating, compared to a 4.2 for Roku 3.I will update this review regularly for a while, so check back for more information Also if you have questions or comments, please feel free to ask them in the comments section. Either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them.UPDATE 1:Based on comments, I wanted to add a few points.Regarding comments that I received the item free or are paid by Amazon to write this review, etc.I paid the full list price and local sales tax for this box (grrr). Nothing was provided to me nor was I paid anything to write about this device. I do not work for Amazon, I own my own company. For this item, I am just a customer. In fact, I didn't expect to even purchase a Fire TV prior to it being announced because I figured it would only deal with Amazon's own content which I feel is much weaker than Netflix. In fact, I have talked two different family members into getting Netflix over Amazon's Prime Streaming service in the past month alone.HBO Go:This has been repeated over and over in the comments but HBO Go support for me is not something I am interested in as I do not have cable service anymore nor do I feel that HBO is a better value than Netflix. I would not go without Netflix support at all but I personally think HBO Go is more niche for many people and honestly I bet this device will get that channel before too long. Clearly the HBO Go people seem to be pushing the issue but I know 11 streaming box users and none use HBO Go so while I noted the missing feature above, people still seem to want to beat me up over it.UPDATE 2:CHANNELS:It needs to be said that some channels require cable/satellite subscriptions (to those channels) like HBO Go (not currently on this box), Showtime, ESPN, etc. Even if you have HBO, it does not mean that your provider allows the HBO Go, so look into that before purchasing any box with that in mind. I do like the Bloomberg TV (not available on Roku 3) App which actually features a LIVE TV feature.NETFLIX APP: Is the older style with the tall covers (like VHS boxes) instead of the new Netflix interface that uses short wide covers (like on Roku 3). Netflix has said they are moving everything to the new software but the Fire TV box doesn't have it yet. That makes comparing performance harder from Roku 3 to Fire TV. On my ISP provider Comcast (Netflix recently agreed to pay Comcast so they have faster streams to customers) I do not see a HUGE improvement in performance in buffing like you see on other channels. What it does seem to do is start in better quality and/or speed the improvement in quality. My guess is that the Netflix app needs to be tweaked to maximize the performance of this hardware. One positive with the FireTV app is that it plays the entire TV episode BEFORE switching to a small window with the countdown starting for the next episode. I can't tell you how many times I had to click, click, click and click just to see the end of an episode under Roku 3.Also, the FireTV Netflix app has two features that were removed from the updated Roku app. Before going into a TV show, FireTV tells you how many total episodes that Netflix has. On the Roku it shows you the number of seasons instead. I personally prefer the number of episodes but clearly that is a personal preference. Another point worth mentioning is that the FireTV Netflix App shows you how many items you have in your list and what item number you are on. That information is missing from the Roku 3 Netflix app.AMAZON PRIME CONTENT: Does not loop--a feature they should add (and likely will). This means once you get to the end, it just stops instead of keeping going.VOICE SEARCH:Voice search DOES cover some 3rd party content, despite everyone reporting it works on Amazon's content only. I have repeated confirmed it supports the VEVO app and will find music videos in that app. That may mean that other 3rd party apps are covered as well, or certainly might be able to be in the future. If you search for something that has PRIME content and VEVO content, it will default to the option with the most options. To switch to the other, simply arrow up and either left or right to see the music videos or PRIME search results.OPTICAL OUT:I noticed this box featured an optical out port but normally run everything through my LG TV (via HDMI) and then use an optical out to my receiver (so I never have to change the receiver's settings) so I wasn't excited about this addition to the Fire TV box over my Roku 3 boxes. I stand corrected. I decided to run my audio via the optical cable into the receiver directly from this Fire TV box (something that I can not do with Roku 3) and it fixed all random lip-sync issues I have from time to time on the Roku 3 box (and the same with the HDMI output on this box).Now I know this is not a typical setup for many people but I do know that tons of people have lip-sync issues with HDMI connections so being able to bypass the HDMI minefield is much more important than I expected.VEVO APP:This app works better than the Roku 3 app performance wise...one quick example is that some content simply fails on the Roku 3 app--try watching Britney Spears's Work B**CH (don't make fun of me). Vevo can play this video fine on YouTube and on the Fire TV app but struggles on Roku 3's app. SOME of VEVO's content is also available via VOICE SEARCH too.REMOTE:I do miss the jump back button on the remote that Roku 3 features. It is a tiny thing but it once you are used to jumping back to see that painting in the background or catch that line that you didn't hear because the phone rang, or someone was talking, you feel lost without it. UPDATE They did include this feature but hid it abit. You simply double click the reward button to skip back. I haven't seen anyone else mention this tip so you saw it here first peopleI do like that the enter button is back in the center of the directional keys. This is the way it used to be on Roku boxes before someone at Roku decided to move it below the directional keys, so you have to move your thumb oddly to press it.MULTITASKING:What multitasking you ask Since you haven't seen this advertised or mentioned elsewhere, I can understand your confusion but try this: Load a Pandora stream...then click on the HOME button and browse for movies/tv you want to watch. As long as you are in the Home/Amazon Prime content, you can browse WHILE Pandora continues playing. Now Pandora dies when you enter another APP like Netflix but it shows you that Multitasking is built into the operating system and may be utilized in future features. (Again, this TIP is only found here)Another update: This tip also works when browsing PLEX content before you play something. So even when utilizing a 3rd party app, it can keep going. When it changes to a new song, a small window pops up on the lower right hand side of the screen to tell you know the new song title and artist.PLEX APP:Compared to the Roku app, PLEX for FireTV is totally different. There are some cool features, like the backgrounds, the screensaver using your photos and the MUCH faster menuing (night and day from Roku 3) but I do miss the channels not requiring a couple clicks to switch to ONLINE to see. I do miss that clicking the play button doesn't play a clip, instead you select it (click) and then play it (second click).SCREENSAVER:FireTV has a screensaver that is honestly pretty cool in my opinion. I am not saying you can't do this with other boxes but no other box comes set up to display random photos (and includes a decent amount of beautiful photos as well.) This functionality covers 3rd party apps like Netflix and Plex too so you have a seamless slideshow no matter what you are using when it starts. This is the sort of thing you see on PCs not streaming boxes and it is a nice touch.GAME CHANGING:Many commenters have argued that this device is not gaming changing and many have rating my review not helpful because of that title.I said Nothing else is this fast to which one commenter said, Nobody cares how fast an streaming box is. That's not a game changerActually using it you will see what I mean. This is the first time a company has put so much into creating a very solidly made hardware device. Like a fast computer (which this basically is), it will depend on software that is written for it to fully show off its abilities.When AMD created their first processor that competed directly with Intel's higher end processors, it was a game changer, correct, because it changed the landscape of personal computers forever, lowered pricing, etc.People will look back in 5 years at this moment and say Amazon's FireTV changed how consumer streaming video boxes were made (instead of barely enough processing power to stream, they became able to compete with HTPCs and Mac Minis).

I was really looking forward to using what was hyped as an amazing piece of entertainment equipment, but the actual experience falls short.Pros:+ User interface and underlying hardware is fast+ Form factor of the device and remote control is very sleek+ Plays games fairly well, especially for such a small box+ Quality of Amazon videos is very good+ Voice search works quite well+ The device came pre-configured for my Amazon account. I just plugged it in, updated the software, and away I wentCons:- First and foremost, there is STILL no way to search for only free movies on Prime.- Amazon touts it's 40,000 Prime movies available, but good luck finding them. There is no categorization by genre. You are stuck surfing through dumb lists of movies, or using the search function, which almost never returns any Prime movies- Voice search works only on Amazon content. You cannot use this to search within Netflix, for example- The Amazon FireTV box only comes with 8GB of memory for game and app storage, which is completely inadequate. There are games available for download that consume almost 2GB for ONE GAME. Good luck downloading a 1.76GB game, like the racing game featured in the list of top games.Clearly, Amazon is marketing this device as a way to push its video content. In the help video that automatically plays the first time you use the device, it even offers you a 30 day Prime membership for free to try it out. However, Amazon has no incentive to help you actually search for and find this free content. It's clearly evident in the lack of ability to filter search results on free Prime content only. This is my biggest beef with Amazon, by far. I want a Netflix-like experience, where my Prime content is sorted by genre, and I can search for free movies only. Now, if you want to pay for video rentals, by all means buy this device, because it works really well. If you want it to access your Prime content only, stick to the Roku box you probably already have, because it works just as good.UPDATE:I called customer service, and talked to a guy about how I can search for and access my 40,000 Prime movies. Well....YOU CAN'T According to him, I can only find the Prime movies on the two lists on FireTV that say Recently added to Prime and Top Prime Movies. Those lists are 73 items, and 150 items, respectively. THERE IS NO WAY TO SEARCH OR BROWSE FREE PRIME CONTENT ONLY. The guy I talked to said this was a very common request for people. OF COURSE IT IS. I don't want to pay for video rentals if I just paid for a Prime membership to access free content. AMAZON COMPLETELY FAILED. I AM RETURNING THE FIRE TV.
I have used the Fire TV for a day, and I think that it is an enormous leap forward in set top box functionality. My brief review follows. But first, I'd like to comment on some of the negative reviews I've seen for the product. Many of them are from people who haven't purchased the product. Others gripe about what the product doesn't have, even though they product clearly states that it doesn't have it - for example, there is a lot of grousing about no HBOGo. Whether that comes to the FireTV or not, it isn't available right now. A one star review because one app is missing Or you can't stream some content from your hard drive (even though there are apparently apps that will perform this task for the Fire TV) Well, take those types of reviews for what they might be worth.Let me start by saying that I own two Roku 2's. I've owned Roku's for quite some time. I don't own the Roku 3, so my comparisons are probably stale. The Roku is a great product, and you can't go wrong owning one. But let me describe the features of the FireTV that have so far delighted me:1. Easy connection to my WiFi connection. I have never been able to connect to my 5G network where my TV is located with my Roku. The Fire TV picked up the signal easily, and streaming is seamless. It could be the dual antennas. Whatever the reason, if signal capture is an issue for you, the Fire TV seems to work well.2. Loading of videos is very fast, almost instantaneous. I select a video, press the remote to play, and within 2 seconds the video is streaming with no buffering issues. It's very impressive.3. Set-up was a breeze. EDIT: I have read that some people had an issue with the initial update that the Fire TV requires. Mine updated with no problems. I was able to connect to my WiFi, and my update downloaded and installed automatically.4. Voice search is very well done. It took me a couple of attempts to learn to search after pressing the button and then hearing the beep to talk. Once I figured that out, I was searching for movies and TV shows easily. The search results have been accurate. This is a huge time saver and a great convenience. Only Amazon content is selected during the search process. I understand that the other content providers have to permit search into their applications for it to work.I have not figured out how to fling my Fire HDX screen to my TV yet. Once I figure this out, it will open up all kinds of other options for the Fire TV. I didn't buy the product for this feature, but I'm interested to get it working. This could be a huge game changer, as you can access content at other sites on the web and display it on your TV. I hope Amazon provides more help to accomplish this.I purchased the gaming controller and was able to pair it with the Fire TV. I haven't played anything yet. But I'm intrigued by the options.One disappointment I have to mention: where is Amazon music My music collection should be available front and center. There's an app for my phone, there is an Amazon music player app for Roku, so Amazon should integrate the music collection. It makes sense that they would do so in order to bring even more value to the entire Amazon content platform. I'm thinking that there will be something shortly, as the rumor is that Amazon is going to provide a music streaming service in the very near future. Amazon needs to address this promptly.Overall, if graded as just a simple streaming box, it gets a 5. With the other options the Fire TV may provide - Miracast screen duplication, games, etc., the product certainly exceeds my expectations.UPDATED 4/5/14: I've had the Fire TV for two days now. I was so pleased I purchased another, and they have now replaced my Roku 2XD's. Both of mine set up in no time, and had no issues connecting quickly to my WiFi network and installing the initial download. I don't have a over-technical set-up for my WiFi. I have a Comcast cable modem (3rd gen) and a Netgear router. My Fire's saw the router with ease, and connected the 5G band. This is something only one of my Roku's could do because of the distance that one of them was from the router.The video quality is superb. I don't have these boxes set up to take advantage of Dolby 5.1, just simple TV speakers. But, the sound is forceful and clear. I've not had any issues of whining or other distortion that some have mentioned.The voice search is frankly amazing. I have read that some people don't like it or feel it is too limited. But for searching your Amazon options it is outstanding. For me, it is fast and accurate and is a huge time saver. I am eagerly awaiting adoption of the technology by other app vendors.The screen layout does take some time getting used to. I won't call it clunky, but it is crowded. It lists items in a fairly rigid order depending upon the category you are in. And yes, Amazon content comes first. That' to be expected. But Amazon doesn't block your access to other apps. If you want HULU or Netflix, you can get to them easily. You can even use voice search to find the app you want. I suspect there will be some streamlining of the interface at some point. The interface does tie into the interfaces on Fire HDX somewhat, so I can see the attempt at consistency here.Gaming so far has been limited, but I've found a great pinball app and am reliving my younger days on the tables. The gaming controller works well, and I don't have any lag playing the game. I haven't attempted any others yet, but I look forward to a good driving game. I'm a casual gamer, not hard-core, and this system may just fit the bill. My Xbox glory days are over, as my kids thoroughly thrash me at Call of Duty.All in all, this box delivers exactly what I wanted and more.
I am sooo impressed with Amazon Fire TV. Believe it or not, I sit and watch the screensaver lots a lot because the pictures are just that good. It is like taking a trip around the world. The amount of things you can do with this Fire TV is pretty incredible to me. There is so much on here and that can be added as apps is impressive. There is a massive amount of things to watch, both free with Prime and much that is a fee to rent or buy. I am glad I made this purchase. This unit is so small I will take it with me on vacation and just plug it in to any TV with the HDMI and keep up with my favorite shows.
I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!
Amazon Fire is misleading. I recommend staying with an Apple TV. The device is very fast and the instant play is one of a kind. The voice search is unmatched by anything on the market. The only problem with the voice search and instant play is it only works for Amazon Prime videos. That is a disclaimer that should be noted somewhere. At least in small print.
I bought this to supplement my OTHER streaming devices. I already have a Sony Google TV, which supports the Amazon Prime Streaming and YouTube etc. It connects to my TV using the HDMI. AND I have an Android tablet that lets me connect through the HDMI to my TV.The reason I bought the FIRE TV was I was under the impression I could use it to download Apps, (which is sort of true), and the App I wanted to use was the Xfinity TV GO. I have it on my Android Tablet, but since it's wi-fi only, it suffers a lot from stutters and stops etc. So I figured since the FIRE TV connects to my CAT-5/LAN, I would have a faster connection.FIRST GRIPE - When I get the FIRE, first thing I tried to find was the Xfinity App. It wasn't on the FIRE's Menu at all. Then I got on Amazon's site, and found it on Amazon's App Store, but there's a great big RED X next to the app, saying It's not compatible - D R A TSECOND GRIPE. No matter what I've tried to do, I cannot figure out how to limit my browsing of movies and TV Shows to ONLY show Prime eligible content. On my SONY Goggle TV, the app that came with it lets me filter out the content so that only my Prime Membership Free Streaming shows up in my search results. IMHO, this a less than subtle method of forcing you to make a buying decision every time you look for content. I don't know which is worse, no filters or embedded advertising.THIRD GRIPE - The APP store is extremely limited. There's just a little over 100 apps available. Considering this is an Android device, and the Android Play Store probably has well over 10,000 apps.... that's very poor APP support.OH YES, Either I couldn't find it, or THERE IS NO WEB BROWSER.It seems that everyone that makes one of these devices, has their own little world that they support, and they try to block out every one else that could be competition. The end result is the Consumer ends up paying the penalty. AMAZON needs to wake up - Not everyone is in love with Amazon.Yes, for a first timer, The Fire is a reasonably slick device to own, but I simply can't see the point in keeping the FIRE. It's so extremely limited as compared to a REAL Android device, and everything it does is already duplicated on one of my OTHER devices.I am sending it back for a refund.
There are many things I like about Amazon Fire TV, but I get tired of having to reset it a lot of times. I have to unplug and plug it in after every use with Netflix. For some reason the screen turns white the second time I use the app ( would be great if you could fix this issue) Considering it took me an hour to get it initially started because of an update, which makes no sense for a new product it has worked so so... It freezes up when streaming videos on HULU a good bit. I would like to have the option to remove shows from your watch list, especially when I view a show for the first time and don't like it. Sometimes the shows will start and then go right back to the homepage. This should not be happening without a button being depressed. I guess everything new has bugs but my question would be when is Amazon going to update the product and fix some of these bugs
I have had Apple TV and Roku for over a year and I can say without reservation that the Amazon Fire TV is far better for two reasons: 1. The program/movie I want to watch starts IMMEDIATELY with a single click, unlike Roku and Apple TV which can take forever at times after several clicks. 2. Voice search. Having to type search can be cumbersome and a nuisance. Unless I want to watch one of the ITunes movies I own on the Apple TV, I always use the Fire. It's simply better
I was really looking forward to using what was hyped as an amazing piece of entertainment equipment, but the actual experience falls short.Pros:+ User interface and underlying hardware is fast+ Form factor of the device and remote control is very sleek+ Plays games fairly well, especially for such a small box+ Quality of Amazon videos is very good+ Voice search works quite well+ The device came pre-configured for my Amazon account. I just plugged it in, updated the software, and away I wentCons:- First and foremost, there is STILL no way to search for only free movies on Prime.- Amazon touts it's 40,000 Prime movies available, but good luck finding them. There is no categorization by genre. You are stuck surfing through dumb lists of movies, or using the search function, which almost never returns any Prime movies- Voice search works only on Amazon content. You cannot use this to search within Netflix, for example- The Amazon FireTV box only comes with 8GB of memory for game and app storage, which is completely inadequate. There are games available for download that consume almost 2GB for ONE GAME. Good luck downloading a 1.76GB game, like the racing game featured in the list of top games.Clearly, Amazon is marketing this device as a way to push its video content. In the help video that automatically plays the first time you use the device, it even offers you a 30 day Prime membership for free to try it out. However, Amazon has no incentive to help you actually search for and find this free content. It's clearly evident in the lack of ability to filter search results on free Prime content only. This is my biggest beef with Amazon, by far. I want a Netflix-like experience, where my Prime content is sorted by genre, and I can search for free movies only. Now, if you want to pay for video rentals, by all means buy this device, because it works really well. If you want it to access your Prime content only, stick to the Roku box you probably already have, because it works just as good.UPDATE:I called customer service, and talked to a guy about how I can search for and access my 40,000 Prime movies. Well....YOU CAN'T According to him, I can only find the Prime movies on the two lists on FireTV that say Recently added to Prime and Top Prime Movies. Those lists are 73 items, and 150 items, respectively. THERE IS NO WAY TO SEARCH OR BROWSE FREE PRIME CONTENT ONLY. The guy I talked to said this was a very common request for people. OF COURSE IT IS. I don't want to pay for video rentals if I just paid for a Prime membership to access free content. AMAZON COMPLETELY FAILED. I AM RETURNING THE FIRE TV.
Hi I bought One but it is dont work in my Country Saudi Arabia Is ther Anysolution . Thanks

This is a device that works as advertised. It is simple and quick to set up but requires a call to the internet provider in order to obtain the necessary password. Since I never watch any netword TV except 'Fox' having movies available at all times is very satisfying.
Amazon is the real deal. Easy to install and use. I'm not into the mainstream TV programming so I like to ability to choose what I want to watch and when. It has the other similar brands beat hands down.
in the middle out and had to wait for it to reboot I'm glad Im glad I purchased the Amazon Fire TV thank you.
I love this thing, its what I have been looking for in entertainment, its very fast and does gaming well but Amazon slipped up when they only gave this gem 8 gigs of storage space. This is a game changer for sure but it needs at the very least 128 gigs to fully enjoy Fire TV. Would have loved to give Fire TV 5 stars but 8 gigs is being cheap considering that most game titles are now 50 - 300 megs each.oh and one more thing, it needs googles play store so us Android users can use our paid games on this machine as well.
In addition to the Fire TV, I have an Apple TV as well as a ChromeCast. By far and large, the best product is the Fire TV. I use it more than both the other ones combined. Having integration between my Prime list and the device is clutch, as I consume media across several different devices.I do wish I could search by Prime Instant, so I hope they will fix that. I also wish I could cast a Prime Instant streaming video from a device to the Fire TV, but I don't see that as an option (although I can cast YouTube to my Fire TV, which is really cool).There is no doubt that it is faster than both Apple TV and ChromeCast, and the voice recognition is SO convenient. I also have the game controller, and the games are pretty good. I don't game much, but I wanted to check it out. I was surprised at the speed of the games and the level of engagement.I'd also like to be able to see a future improvement where screens can be mirrored from devices to this (both ChromeCast and Apple TV have this). From an educator's standpoint, this could be the 100 solution to wireless projection for classroom teachers (Apple TV doesn't play well with enterprise level security, and ChromeCast doesn't do well with some software that is essential for instruction).All in all, it's my favorite media device. It's faster, has a great and snappy UI, and is easy to setup.
I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase
Thank you for another awesome device, Amazon.My husband and I were impressed with the lack of lag and drop outs while watching movies. We have 2 of these devices and loving them both.
I like the voice search and speed of this unit. The things i don't like is that i have to keep uninstalling apps to be able to keep on using this thing. The fire TV does not even come close to the app selection for watching TV compared to the Roku. So if you are looking at a TV watching device buy a Roku.
I love my amazon prime membership. I use it to stream TV and movies, and I love that I can download content to my Fire as well. I bought a Roku a couple of years ago and it has truly changed the way I use my prime membership. Because I use it for TV and movies, it reaffirms that the new price is worth it.I had been considering buying a second Roku for a secondary TV, but when I saw this new device, I bought it right away Here are my thoughts:SET UPSo simple to set up. Including opening the package, it took me 5 minutes (I timed it). All I had to do was connect the device to the HDMI and plug it in. Then I put in my WIFI password. Because the device is so slim and small, I have it sitting under my HDTV on the console. I feel like the cords are neater there.It took an additional 38 minutes to update the software, so it did take a while to actually be able to use it. I loved that as soon as it finished loading, a short, fun and helpful startup instructional video ran.Since I bought it for myself on amazon, it was automatically uploaded with my account info.NAVIGATING AMAZON VIDEO CONTENTIt gave me the option to add parental controls in the form of a pin to my account, which I did, because I didn't want my kids to accidentally (or on purpose) buy an episode. At first I was frustrated by this, because Amazon Prime content wasn't showing up. If I tried to access something on my watchlist, I had to select other viewing options to watch via Prime. I'm still not sure why this is. Then I still had to put my pin in, which made me wonder if I was buying it. I went to settings and was able to leave the pin on for purchased content and turn it off for Prime content, which is what I want. Then it made it easier to access the prime content.VOICE SEARCHThis does work It's great. You push the button on the remote and speak the title or actor. Amazingly intuitive.APPSI added the YouTube app and it was easy to sign in to my account and access my videos. I'm sure my kids will love this.AS COMPARED TO ROKUI'm still out on this. The Roku 2 (which is the one I have) is at least twenty dollars cheaper and is what I was planning to buy for my 2nd TV. I really like the voice search feature over the Roku search. And it does seem to be faster.However, the navigation of the actual prime content isn't as easy to access as on the amazon app on the Roku. Part of it might be unfamiliarity, but it seems like it's easier to find prime content via the app on the Roku than the TV/Movie section on the Fire TV (It doesn't seem to have Prime set apart separately like on the app I use on the Roku).I do like the games availability and think my 10 year old son will enjoy it. It was one thing that caused me to buy it. He enjoys playing Angry Birds on the Roku, but that's where it ends there. It also comes with 500 coin credit to use.
I really like the equipment. It is small and works well. The voice search feature is nice. Could have been a home run. Fire stars.However, not being able to down select to see just prime not so cool. Even the iPad app does that.... So one star for that. Go fix it Update your software
We live in an RV and we get internet through our phones Hotspot or from free WiFi in RV Parks. Fire TV is sometimes the only way to pick up the TV Shows we have missed. I have not been able to find CBN or The Blaze TV on the device. Those and two of my favorites that I used to watch on the Roku device that I miss.
Technically the best compared to others on the market, my complaint is that the selection of movie apps such as Vudu which I have a very large library and the lack of Cable apps such as HBO GO.
Might be a victim of hype, but Fire TV didn't meet my expectation. Honestly, don't see evidence it's game changing.
I love the features of the Amazon Fire TV, the price is right, the interface is great, but it after less than 5 minutes keeps disconnecting from my WIFI and giving a network error message. Mind you my router is about 5 feet from it. Needless to say because of this I cant watch Amazon prime TV shows or movies on it. I have an Apple TV in my sons room way down the hall also connected to WIFI, the Apple TV never disconnects from WIFI. I would love to be able to use the unit, not sure why this is happening but I may have to return it. Shame....
It seems to work fine so far (2 Days with it). What I don't like is how Amazon has made it so thePrime content is mixed with the For Pay content, with no easy way to just see what is ONLY Prime content. This is obviously made to divert you into buying more non Prime content...Amazon, please give us a CLEAR way to view Prime Only if that's what we want. I know we can voice search for anything... and that's great, but sometimes we just want to Go Fishing and would like to fish in the Prime pond only. This is a pretty big deal when you compare this to competing (Think ROKU) products that let you do just that.Hard to believe your competition does a better job with presenting your own content than you do. Maybe an update in the near future will Fix this.

cancelled ATT U-verse and bought this w/ netflix and amazon prime. so far we are very happy - especially kids as they have all their favorite shows/movies
The reason this is the 2nd best purchase, is because my Kindle Fire HD is 1st... This has been a great purchase and has so many options available when connected with Amazon Prime. I have never been a big TV Watcher in the last few years, but I am back to it a bit with this device coupled with Amazon Prime. I watch Movies and TV Shows with my wife and it is great. If you spend much time in front of the TV, then I would say this is a must have and I love it almost as much as my Kindle Fire HD..
This is a wonderful streaming device. I have been an Apple TV man since 2008, but I have decided that I just might never return to my Apple TV. I have used/owned all 3 generations and have known them inside and out (unlocked my 1st generation for secret stuff. Shhhh) and swore by them for years. I just received my amazon fire tv device this afternoon and plugged it up without a hitch. Voice command is a nice touch, but I was most impressed with the speed of the quad core processor. No more waiting for my videos to buffer, and this is especially important in my house where my wife, kids, and I are sometimes simultaneously streaming videos. Final word: If you're just looking for a great device to stream both Netflix and Amazon Prime, then you've found the right streamer.
Well after using it last night and sleeping on it, (the experience... didn't actually sleep on my Fire TV) I had been debating between 4 and 5 stars. I am a longtime media streamer. I have 7 Rokus and have bought 3 more as gifts to family. I also have a Chromcast and an Xbox 360. Additionally I have tried various other streaming devices such as Netgear NeoTV, the D-Link MovieNite etc.(I am still trying to figure out why I bought the Chromecast the least useful gadget I have ever owned. )First of all the Fire TV is everything that Amazon claims it is. It is fast. It is sleek. The interface is handsome and of course very Kindle Fire like.After hooking it up it immediately downloaded updates. ( An annoying process that almost every new computing device does whether it is a phone, tablet, streamer, or computer. It seems to take forever but it is really not that long, it is just that we are in Christmas Morning opening presents mode and time slows down when you are excited about trying something new. -) )I give it 5 stars because Amazon delivered what it said it would. I doubt it will replace anyone's existing favorite. I would recommend it to anyone just entering the streaming media game and who has kids and Amazon Prime. It is a fantastic portal to Amazon products.Many people have tried to compare it to Roku, Apple, Chromecast etc but to me I compare it to my XBox. It plays Video, Music and Games so for some, who want to have a less expensive alternative to an XBox One, there it is. (Of course you cannot compare it XBox One or PS4 but not everyone wants to shell out 50 - 60 dollars for a game or 400-500 for a game console. This is plenty for the casual gamer or kids.)Being on the Android platform will allow the number of apps to increase exponentially and for watching Amazon's videos (Prime and Pay) it is perfect.About the experience....For Amazon's offerings it is the best out there. I highly recommend Amazon Prime as it is comparable to Netflix plus I have saved a bundle on free shipping. The interface for the movies is first class. The remote's FF and RW buttons also act as skip forward and skip back buttons. Press RW once to jump back 10 seconds or hold to rewind. Same for the FF button. The interface for Amazon video is similar to the new one for Netflix on Roku 3 with the entire screens background feature the highlight movie. Surprising the interface for Netflix on Fire TV is the older one not the new one.The Plex app works fine for all my DLNA needs. (playing media from my home computers)Wish list.1. Allow us to change the position of Apps. When you start adding apps the latest one is the first one on the list, so add them in reverse order to get your most frequently used ones at the top of the list. There is a row of tiles for Recently Watched that allow you remove from that list but it is kludgey. Those of you who have a kindle fire will recognize the system. Or add a quick Access or Favorites row of tiles at the top of the Home Screen.2. Would love to have Amazon tie into the Ultraviolet system. I have close to 200 movies there. You can reach it through the Flixster app but HD is not available on the Flixster app.3. HBOGo4. Vudu5. HBOGo6. Vudu7. HBOGo8. VuduAmazon....Get my pointIn summary I will keep it and use it for Amazon offerings. It will sit beside my Roku 3 which I will use for everything else until the apps on my Roku get ported to Fire. I do wish it had and infrared sensor so my Harmony remote could use it but it is not a showstopper.
I really like the Fire TV box so far. The voice search thing is pretty good, but I just wish it had the ability to surf the internet.
I got mine from an electronics store, because I didn't want to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Setup was a breeze. I don't have cable, so prior to this, I had to hook my laptop up to my TV to enjoy Prime and Netflix content on it. I'm also really pleased that they added a YouTube app That was the number one drawback for me when considering this device. From what I've read, I figured I'd sideload one, but they saved me the trouble.Once I signed in to YouTube and linked my mobile devices, I even gained the ability to send content to my TV for viewing I don't have a Fire phone or Kindle (although I do have a Paperwhite), so I'm not able to comment on the connectivity with those.I can't say enough good things about this tiny box. I've had it for a couple of months and use it every day The user interface is intuitive and efficient. I really love the screen saver pictures, too. Most of them are breathtaking, and they seem to update periodically. The voice search is very accurate. There are a decent amount of apps for added content. I mostly stick to the abovementioned sources, but I added Crackle for a bit of variety.My only complaint would be about the rewind/fast forward. It's not intuitive, and takes some getting used to. I don't use that feature often, so it's no biggie to me.I did feel a bit weird about not being able to turn it off at first, but I got used to that, too. Just make sure to press the Home button when you're done for the evening or whatever, because you leave it paused in the middle of a show or something, it won't go to sleep. It remembers your place in whatever you were watching, so no worries about that.I look forward to continued software improvements, and plan on getting a game controller sometime soon, so I can try out the games.
This review is to try to offset some of Roku employees that are on here trying to knock this device.The first thing you notice after plugging everything in, is a 3-5 minute demo that you can unfortunately not bypass, even if you know your way around these types of devices. You will only see it once, and then you're good to go. The device is small and beautiful. The remote is better than any other device, including Roku 3, and my WD TV Live.First the PROs:- It's the fastest media streamer, by far. That's not only a good thing if you own one, but it will force Roku and other companies to stop skimping on the hardware, and firmware updating.- The menu is intuitive and easy to maneuver. You can't move things around yet, but I'm sure they will eventually let you customize your own page. As of now, the apps (which would be at the top, if I could change it) are at the bottom. Apps are larger and higher resolution than the Roku.- The voice button is amazing. For a first attempt, they almost got it right. I understand this is a proprietary device, so they will always want you to use Amazon instant video for your viewing. But this option should search for all of your linked accounts, including Hulu, Netflix, etc. I'm not sure that they will ever fix this, because they will lose money and viewers. Even so, it's still a PRO, because it does work well.- Streaming quality - WOW Everything I've tried buffers so quickly, that it's almost already at 1080p when it starts playing. With my Roku, Netflix looks great, but it takes 5-10 seconds to get there. I currently have 100Mbps of internet, so I'm not sure what everyone else goes through, but I can tell you this streams better than Roku. Period.- Overheating and reboots - My Roku 3 cannot handle more than a couple of hours of viewing before it decides that was too many rows of stairs. It gets exhausted, and it has to reset itself. This device is more powerful, and after using it all day today, I can say my Roku 3 will be immediately up for sale, once they add the Time Warner Cable and HBOgo apps.-- PLEX -- Okay, I always blamed my Plex for the long delays on my Roku. With my internet speeds, I could never understand why it was always loading at 1080p settings, regardless of the bitrate. Anyway, I was wrong. It's the device. Not only does the Fire TV have a much better PLEX app (which is beautiful, btw), but everything streams at maximum quality within seconds. No re-loading (buffering) during movie playback. And the movies are in a much nicer grid layout, so I don't have to sift through one row to get to a movie selection.Now the CONS:- Obviously it's still missing some apps. You are crazy if you think HBOgo will go much longer without being added. The same for other apps. They built it, so they WILL come.- Interface - it is nice, but as I stated in the PROs, you can't make changes to it, hopefully just for now. If it stays this way, it will be a little annoying to have to scroll down all the way just to get to my apps.- One major issue that is very upsetting to me, is the fact that they couldn't add two very important things - USB 3.0, and 802.11ac. If Amazon claims they were listening, they would also know that these two things would dramatically improve the user experience. I haven't plugged my WD 4TB hard to it yet, but it is a 3.0 hard drive. Now it will unfortunately revert to 2.0 speeds. Don't build a supposedly forward-thinking device with two things that are now considered dated. I have a feeling this was done to make money off the Fire TV 2. Thanks for that.Overall, it is the best device currently available, and they really made the experience fun. It does make you want to call your cable company and cancel service. Buy it...you will not regret it.

this thing is amazing. I wish there was someplace you could go to see ALL the titles available on prime. everything I've seen shows a few here and a few there but this device is terrific highly recommended
Having bought 2 of the Roku 3 and I am a little spoiled. The Fire has very few or limited, outdated apps. (Mostly Amazon Apps) No HBO Go, No PBS, No TargetTicket, Showtime Anytime is out of date, (Does not list DirecTV as provider) No VUDU It does have Flixster but it loads very slow. The USB port is useless Why is even there What a let down Sending mine back Not worth 99
Easy to set up literally plug it in, download the apps wanted, and go. No software installation. No issues-so far. Incredibly user friendly interface. The only thing I am slightly pissed about is the fact that my signature/someone answering the door wasn't required when the package was delivered, a 100 piece of equipment was just left on my doorstep. Other than that, I'm quite happy with it

It was a snap to set up and get a going. Movies and T.V. A delight to watch. Themusic comes clear and while playing just love those graphics. Another winner as faras I'm concerned.
We ditched cable two years ago and live on Netflix and Amazon Prime. The Fire TV is for our second TV. It setup fast, though I was disappointed that it spent five minutes updating initially. The intro was fast, professional and showed the basic features.We currently use a Sony Blu Ray Player for our primary TV. The Fire TV is much faster to key through screens and items. The antenna for the wifi is superior, connecting our upstairs TV to the downstairs wireless router. The Fire TV starts streaming content instantly, no boot up time.We are very happy to add this streaming device to our home.
As background I own several Apple TVs, Roku 3's and Chromecasts. Along with plenty of other devices. I also have a large investment in BluRay and DVD, having had over 5,000 films during my peak of building out a Home Theater. With that comes a substantial UV (Vudu Flixster) and Digital Copy library (iTunes).Initial usage of the Fire TV has shown me that this box is fast and flexible. The voice search is excellent. BUT for some reason the search only picks up Amazon content. It does NOT currently show available media on Flixster or Netflix. This is for something that was touted as an open ecosystem, and not a proprietary one. Well then, how do I access my existing libraryWorse, but along with the previous point easily fixable is the fact that my only access to my UV library is through Flixster. Flixster works great on a tablet. But for some reason the Fire TV is not properly caching the content of my movies, so everytime I launch the app it takes minutes to show the content. Further all recent films are NOT available in HD. This is a huge hole in the openness and functionality of the Fire TV.I can't search on my content.I can't watch much of my content in HD.Easy fixes, but a hard sale for someone who owns a Roku or Apple TV.Fire TV needs VuDu as an app, and access to the iTunes library that folks own to be truly open. I'm vested in UV, and Amazon should take note of that as folks like me are typically the leading edge. UV has matured, and Amazon needs to be a much better partner.UPDATE 4/3/2014 I talked to Amazon.com and they confirmed that NetFlix chose to not enable the search functionality, thus the Fire TV search does not bring up NetFlix content. The same appears true for Flixster, and they confirmed that Fire TV is not currently a supported HD devices for Flixster content. All fixable, but ultimately making the Fire TV currently a closed eco systems with no real access to UV or other parties digital content that customers may already own. It's a tough pill to call up a search for content you own, and only be presented with purchase options from Amazon.
After having the FireTV for about a month now, I can confidently recommend this product for most people. Versus the current generation Apple TV, ChromeCast and Roku offerings, the FireTV is the best value due to it's access to a wide variety of content, build quality and advanced features. It's a device I have recommended to my (almost-elderly) parents my (geeky) friends.Best things about the FireTV: - It is fast - unlike the Roku it does not lag and feels like a high quality product - Has Amazon Prime Video access- if you have prime membership, this is the best accessory you can buy. Lots of great content from Comedy Central and newer movies versus Netflix. - An AppStore with apps games you actually want - Plex Showtime AnyTime are the big difference makers IMO. - If you have local video files on your network, Plex is the way to go. - Voice searchWorst things about the FireTV (which really aren't that bad): - Annoying/long intro video upon the first time you boot up - Larger power adapter versus Apple TV (Yes the little things count) - No HBOGO until late 2014 - Going to be a problem from the folks looking for their Game of Thrones fix this spring** - No chromecast/airplay like feature unless you have an amazon tablet**If you don't need HBOGO right now and don't have a bunch of apple products, stop reading this right now and buy this device. You won't regret it.** See below for ways around thisIf you are an advanced user and/or are on the fence this next section is for you.Before the FireTV, I had 3 Apple Tv 2's in my house that I used to access HBOGO, Hulu+, Netflix my local media through the infuse application. I had tried Roku's, ChromeCast and other media boxes/home theater pc's and the Apple TV worked best for me. While this has served me well there are obvious drawbacks - lack of 1080p video, limited app selection, no games, etc.... Which led me to trying the FireTV.Because the FireTV is based on android, android apps can be side loaded on the device and many work fine. The steps below will outline how to get started side loading apps to your FireTV. You may want to have a usb keyboard and mouse handy - you'll need them to get a few things running. Any old usb keyboard/mouse you have lying around should work OK.(The following links provide the best directions I have come across during my time with the device and have worked for me and should work for you too, but no promises)How to sideload applications to the FireTV:1. The first step in loading android apps is getting ADB set up on your machine can be done by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/connecting-adb2. After that, you can go ahead and proceed with side loading applications, also by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/sdk/asb/app-install.html3. If you aren't comfortable with working with the command line, and are running windows, you can try this great GUI application to automatically side load applications. - forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.phpt2736740Once you are able to send android apps (.apk) files to the FireTV, I recommend:1. Installing MXPlayer to allow .MKV .AVI video file playback: sites.google.com/site/mxvpen/download2. If your network drive/computer doesn't support plex, try using ESFileExplorer to navigate to play back video files - appsapk.com/es-file-explorer/3. AirReceiver which mimics the functionality of airplay on an appletv. Please note this only supports unencrypted video feeds. This is a paid app, buy play.google.com/store/apps/detailsidcom.softmedia.receiver4. HBOGO android app can be installed and works rather well. It does require a mouse to navigate.5. XBMC - If you know what this, you will want it and yes it works. Download via xbmc.orgFor the cord cutters out there, I've tried installing Aereo Slingbox with mixed results. Slingbox for tablets loads and opens ok. Using the mouse I was able to accept the terms conditions and input my user info. Unfortunately it doesn't load the video stream. Other folks have had success apparently, so it may be just me. Aereo side loads opens fine but I couldn't sign up for a trial as I am 1 town over from being in their current market area. I will update this review if I get any further with either.There are many more apps you may want to try so check out this comprehensive list of app functionality from the reddit.com/r/firetv folks - docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uD6cesLVtHwsoWDE9jlKsV9FtlUbQ3KvDQp6N9gbHE/editgid1337307432This list includes information on emulators roms which I didn't include in this review due to their dubious legality.
Amazon billed my credit card prematurely on payment date for monthly installment andhave no way to contact amazon to request due date on account, not happy at all amazondeducted my payment earlier than agreed terms.
I like the device. I had the Apple TV. THE Amazon is better than apple and Roku. The only network Amazon needs is the WWE Network app. There is a lot of WWE fans out there with Amazon that would love this app.
I got mine the day after it was unveiled. Out of the box it required an update. It's the fastest UI of any other box that I have. Currently there aren't as many apps as I would like to see, but I imagine they'll be coming soon.I am not able to get my Kindle Fire HDX to Mirror the display yet. It won't connect for some reason.Including more apps coming soon, apparently the Amazon Music app will be available soon as well. Games are very cool. I don't have the separate controller, but have had fun with the games you can play with the remote.These aren't mediocre games you would find on the Roku 3, but high quality mobile games. Of course the games aren't full on Xbox or PS4 style, but beautifully scaled mobile games you'd play on your smartphone or tablet.If you get your entertainment from the Amazon ecosystem, this is an excellent device.
Amazon Fire TV is a must to have... Especially if you are paying the high prices of Cable TV/On Demand .etc I have cancelled those options am enjoying most of those same features on Amazon Fire TV.Movies, TV weekly shows, music, games. View on TV screen all photos, etc that have been saved on my Amazon CloudLOVE IT....not going to pay the high prices of Cable TV again Easy hook-up (10min) total.Love you Amazon Happy..Happy Customer. o)
This little piece of equipment is a great way to watch movies and TV series. It's so simple to use.
Oddly this device deserves both a five star rating and a 1 star rating at the same time. The things they did right, they did really, really right and blow the competition out of the water but there are serious omissions that I believe an average television watcher is going to surely miss.For watching Amazon content this device is glorious smooth, extremely fast, easy and convenient. The performance is truly impressive and definitely best in class. The voice search worked great for me although I am not pushing it to its limits with a medium range voice and no accent. I love how it was already linked to my account since I purchased it from Amazon, classy touch.Major omissions/annoyances: The remote will not control your TV, so for turning the TV on/off and adjusting volume you will still need another remote.Other content providers (Netflix, Pandora, etc) are not integrated with voice search, so your voice search will only call up Amazon content and to access the others you have to enter into the app explicitly and use an on-screen hunt-and-peck style interface to search. I am hopeful that either the content providers will remedy this in the future or Amazon will sell a bluetooth keyboard for the thing. Perhaps just make my GoogleTV keyboard work :)Also, it does not come with an hdmi cable. Most people probably already have a cable they can use, but I can only imagine the frustration of someone purchasing this and not having the ability to plug it in. This device in its current state will not really replace other devices you have, it would most likely just be an added item for watching Amazon content, so a cable should have been included.Obviously, this is a first impression review (The Fire TV was released yesterday). Some of my first annoyances could be remedied by a future software update, but I don't recommend you buy this product just yet. I am going to keep mine a few days to explore further and then probably send it back. I will update this review.
got as a gift and we love it
This is an awesome product. I had received a Kindle Paperwhite as a Christmas gift, and it has since become an indispensable part of my daily life. The fit and finish of that product is top notch, and so I was eager to see if this one matches the quality I have come to expect from Amazon.Short answer: it does. Everything works perfectly, and I still have trouble believing that they packed this much awesomeness into such a small box. Having had bad experiences with streaming video in the past, I was a little wary about trying this, but I needn't have worried. Browsing menus is fast, the voice search works great, and watching movies is flawless. A nice touch is all of the detailed help videos which are included as the first thing you see after you set up the device.Even setup is easy, fast and fun. Hook it up to the TV, plug it in, enter network password, wait for a short update, and that's it, ready to go.Nice job, big A. Keep this up, and you will force me to buy all of your products.
STICK WITH ROKU, SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE. I WISH I COULD SEND THE FIRE TV BACK. TO OPERATE THE FIRE TV IS JUST A UNNECESSARY MESS. EVEN THE MIC COULD NOT FIND A PROGRAM ON FIRE TV (NETFLIX) THAT IS ON ROKU (NETFLIX). TO ME, I DON'T NEED ALL THE BS TO WATCH A PROGRAM .I'LL GET ANOTHER ROKU AND BE HAPPY.
As an owner of various models of Roku and Apple TVs, I didn't really need yet another streaming device, But, I decided to give it a try. It works great. I do like the voice search feature. We tried watching some of our favorites like Midsommer Murders. All of the seasons and episodes showed up which was nice. But only a few of the earlier seasons were watchable for free, and a few of the more recent were available for 5.99, but most were unavailable. That happened to several other BBC series that we tried to watch. However, the movies we have watched streamed without a hitch with good picture and sound.
This is a great device if you don't have a smart TV (apparently mine streams Amazon Prime, but the interface is so terrible that I never bothered using it) or other streaming device besides the Chromecast (which is very limited).First of all, little things: the packaging was very nice. The remote itself feels amazing to hold and the buttons are very simple. The Fire TV itself is beautiful, very minimalist. All you see is the tiny LED on the front when it's in use.The voice search IS great It didn't catch Idina Menzel, but it could be because I searched her name right after searching John Travolta. It brought up musicals, Will Ferrell, etc. without a problem. Voice search only works within everything available on Prime it seems (things available to rent or stream), and I wish it included the Netflix titles, perhaps with a See on Netflix button instead of just showing me the rent option for what isn't on instant Prime.I wish you could sort by Amazon Prime-only movies, with an interface similar to Netflix's. I want to see what's available to me NOW, not what I can rent.The games are fun, and it's pretty cool to be able to play phone games on the TV. My whole family actually enjoyed playing Minion Rush. I don't have any controllers yet, and I hope that 2P games, if they aren't out yet, are coming in the future.I've only had mine a day, but so far I'm loving this purchase We do have an xbox one, smart tv, and even a computer hooked up downstairs into the same 60 monitor, but the xbone interface for netflix is SO AWFUL that we hardly ever use it (unlike the one on the 360) and it's a pain just to have to start up the computer and interact with such a huge screen with computer peripherals. Because our Vizio smarttv is rather clunky and slow, it has never loaded any video streaming for us before somehow crashing. This Fire TV clears those problems, and with an INCREDIBLY simple interface.Love it I would give this 5 stars if you could use the voice search for commands and inside apps (such as Netflix).EDIT April 11, 2014:After using my Fire TV for about a week, I've settled into what I use it for most (until I get my gaming controller, which is apparently on backorder until the 23rd). I mostly wanted a device to watch my favorite shows (via Netflix or locally) without any troubles. It's MUCH faster to launch and use the Netflix app on the Fire TV than it is on my smart TV, the xbox one, and the computer hooked up to it via HDMI. It's also PERFECT for streaming locally via Plex -- my music, TV shows, movies, and more are so very easily accessible on here vs. the computer hooked up (which is not my PC) and the xbox one (which is such a nightmare for this task that I barely consider it). This app is only 99 cents and will make your Fire TV experience a lot more enjoyable, so you really owe it to yourself to get it.I absolutely love the feel of the remote and how simple and intuitive it is to use. After fiddling with the TV remote for the input button, which despite always being in the same spot, I always have trouble finding, it's a joy to use a remote that is much simpler. This probably makes me sound old (I'm 20). The remote orientation doesn't matter, so you don't fiddle around with making sure you've pointed it correctly. I suppose this is because it uses BT.The voice search, which I use somewhat often, is a joy to use. It's much better than shouting across the room at the Kinect, which only picks up what I say less than half of the time. I hope Microsoft doesn't save voice recordings the same way Amazon does, because about 80 of that is just me yelling profanities at the Kinect.
I have never been happier, or more excited about a purchase anywhere, anytime ever Amazon really does blow all other competition out of the water with this creation It is very user friendly, fast, and fun I am so glad I got it and would highly recommend it
Being an amazon prime member for a few years now, I was hoping they would come up with a product like this. Simple to set up. Easy to use.
So when I moved into my house last year, I made the obligatory call to TWC for internet and cable TV. The bundled me into a 200 dollar per month bill which includes 30 Mbs internet (in theory -- in reality, I never see that), telephone (which I don't use because I have Verizon home phone connect, and TV with whole house DVR, all the premium channels (which I never watch), HDTV etc.After losing my job and having Time Warner get extremely nasty because I chose to spend what 200 bucks I had left on food and gas rather than paying them, AND the fact that they have THE WORST SERVICE (I had to swap out my box and waited in line for over an hour just to swap it out and then when the new box didn't work, wait yet another hour in line to get a 3rd box), I have decided NO MORE TWC.Amazon Fire TV is the corner stone of my plan to cut the cord. I've only had it for awhile tonight but I am so far blown away. The voice recognition works flawlessly (ok -- 1400 reviewers here... raise your hand if your first search term was Porn -- yeah, I'm immature) Regardless of what inappropriate word or attempts to baffle the system my teenage son and I threw at it, it recognized EVERYTHING (with the exception of his Latin -- ok, Amazon fire doesn't recognize Latin ... but neither do I)Went to the YouTube app because that is a part of my plan to ditch TWC -- could I play shows that were on YouTube that I currently watch via cable. Check. Paired with my computer (a mac), I just searched for the video that I want, hit play on the computer and it automatically is displayed on my TV.I've only had it unboxed for 1 hour so haven't tried Netflix or Hulu etc yet but one of the key activities I do a lot of is watching VOD from Amazon and it is SOOOOO much easier to do it using this device that via my BluRay player. Picture quality (even of standard def YouTube videos is nearly as good as cable).The next step of my plan to ditch TWC is getting Fiber Optic DSL installed. Once that has occurred, I will be going from a 200 dollar per month monopoly to 55 bucks per month plus whatever I choose to spend on renting movies etc on demand. AND, I never have to wait in line for hours to swap out hardware that I'm renting from the cable company...So for half the cost of 1 months worth of Time Warner, I'm going to be able to preserve what little is left of my sanity (which isn't much, given that I tried testing this out with bad words like a kindergartener) and the most fun I have had in awhile is listening to the cable customer service rep spend nearly an hour in trying to talk me out of not leaving (HIM: what if we gave you everything you have now for 160 Then would you stay ME: No... if you could provide the same level of service for 40 bucks less than you have been for the last year, why didn't you just do it then rather than making me pay over 40 bucks a month more than I needed to HIM: What if I bumped up your internet bandwidth to the next tier for free ME: Because I'm not even getting the advertised speed as it is)Sorry, TWC -- you are no longer a monopoly. There is another game in town. Thank you Amazon for giving me that ability to cut the cordp.s. (BTW, based on my little Porn experience, I will DEFINITELY be setting up the parental controls)NCJAR
I received my Fire TV today, I am surprised, amazed, thrilled and extremely pleased it's all that and a bag of chips The ease of use is so simple, hookup is a breeze, I had it hooked up and running with in 3 minutes The remote is small so what, My only con is: the voice search should be for everything. To own this and not have Amazon Prime should be a crime, LOL, it's a must for the Fire TV. I gave up Direct TV in January, I was paying to much for what I was getting. With the Fire TV it's customized tv at your finger tips, no more paying for channels you don't need and no more cable bill I hope more people are waking up and ditching pay tv. I pay 7.99 for Netflix, I watch Crackle for free, no more commercials, no more unwanted/un needed channels, movies when I want, sit-coms when I want. no more running to 'pick up' a dvd, I'm telling ya streaming is where it's at and this device is a must Life is hard, this is easy.
Just spent a few hours with my FireTV, and am quite impressed. Setup is incredibly easy, the voice commands work amazingly well, and everything loads quickly. The lack of storage is a major issue if you are planning on using it for gaming. Only 5.6 GB's of space is usable, which can be filled quite quickly by games that push past 1GB a piece.On the plus side wired xbox 360 controllers workAlso, this would be a great device for someone who is not tech savvy. There is a really nice instructional animation that loads the first time you power on the device, and the voice commands make finding content VERY easy.For parents: There are parental controls, and an option to block all in-app purchases. This is a godsend if you have kids.EDIT: There are dozens of reviews from people who don't even have a FireTV. Look for the verified purchase logo on reviews. If it doesn't appear ignore that review as they don't have any experience with the device.
I would have rated this higher (4 stars) but I am taking off 2 stars for not having an 'off' or a 'sleep mode' button. It is supposed to go to sleep after 30 minutes but mine has not gone to sleep much since plugging it in a few days ago. So far it is only a slight improvement over my LG blu-ray players which allows me to watch amazon videos. I only see a few Interesting games so I will continue using my Xbox and my Kindle tablets until more games are available. For the price, I could have waited.
I would give it a 4 star review if it didn't keep having reoccurring issues with wired Ethernet connection. For some reason I have to keep taking out the Ethernet cable and plugging it back in the device in order for it to recognize the wired connection. Now, the funny thing is that the wifi connection works fine. The reason that is funny or ironic is that typically that is where most devices have an issue when it comes to internet connection. The reason I choose being wired in is because I want fast data transfer.. Now, the Fire works well with everything else.. very smooth and the interface is well laid out...
FireTV is basically just what it sounds like: it turns your TV into a giant Kindle Fire. If you are familiar with other streaming media players, youll have an idea of what to expect. FireTV streams video and audio content to your TV from the same providers: Hulu, Netflix, and (of course) Amazon.So lets go through my first experience:Part One: Opening the box (Queue Thus Sprach Zarathustra.)Ok, I have to say it: Nothing impressive here, sorry Amazon. I have to say that the FireTV is about the most boring looking black box Ive ever seen. The good news: It completely disappears on your entertainment center.The remote is pretty bare bones looking. The microphone button grabbed my attention, but otherwise, there are very few buttons. Can I complain that it is both very black and very small Yes, I know that Black is the new Black, but Ive already lost it once and Ive had it for about 2 hours.Ok, enough looky-looky, time to um.hooky-uppy.Part Two: Setup (Where is my That was Easy button)Power: CheckHDMI Cable: CheckTurn on TV: CheckWait for it to bootwaitIts done: Check (That was fast)And done Check Im an Amazon Prime member and my account was already setup on the box and ready to go.Part Three: Interface (What does this button do)Actually, its not rocket science:The Home button takes you back to the home screen.Click the wheel to scroll through options.Hit the button to make your selection.Voice Search: Ok, I will tell you: I am not a big user of voice tech. Really, I hate to use the telephone. I guess Im afraid the pizza guy is going to tell me No But I can see that with a little getting over my own fears, voice search is going to be awesome My FireTV correctly heard all three of my queries. One caveat here: Voice Search only pulls up Amazon content. No a huge deal for my family, but maybe for yours. You can always search the old fashioned way like other streaming boxes.Part Four: Video and AudioAs I said, it was easy to hook up. Just plug it in. Video looked great on my 40 TV. Audio was good over our home stereo. The quality did not seem any better or worse than my other HD set top box.The services available to stream from are also pretty standard fare both on the video and audio front.Part Five: Games (Thousands of games coming)This reminds me a bit of the days when I got the original Kindle Fire. Of course, Amazon made good on their promise there, so I have faith that theyll do the same here. Just a quick view through the list of already available games tells me that there is already a good mix of approved titles for the Fire TV, and more are on the horizon.Please do not mistake this for a NextGen gaming console. It looks like a good choice to be able to play tons of Android games on your big screen.Overall: 4 stars. Fire TV is a very nice mix of old and new. There are a few puzzle pieces missing, but knowing Amazon, theyll be filled in quickly
This was SO easy to set up. We were up running in less than 10 minutes and WOW. This is primarily my hubby's toy (I play on the computer, he flies the TV). Voice search is SUCH a timesaver. I used to have to stop whatever I was doing to type in whatever he needed to search for. NOW, HE CAN HANDLE IT. Speak and ye shall FIND. Love, love, love this boxThe speed of the video loading is awesome, as is the intuitive search function (Amazon KNOWS what he likes, so his lists are more or less pre-filtered so they load faster).I waffled for WEEKS before buying this. I read tons of reviews finally decided it would be worth the temporary (Honey, HOW DO I DO THIS) change in look, feel, etc. (we've been streaming with a Roku since about 2009 had the Roku XD for a long time, just before the change to FireTV).Finally, I decided to try it, thinking if Hubby had too much difficulty adapting, we'd just send it back (while also TRUSTING AMAZON to have made a massive leap forward--have never, myself, been disappointed with any of their electronic offerings).I was expecting to have to sync it with our router, sign on to our accounts again and again (Amazon, Netflix, etc.).NOPE. Plug it in.It turned itself ON.Updated ITSELF.FOUND my router.Was PRE-LOADED with my Amazon account.We were from box to watching in under 10 minutes (there's even a 2 or 3 minute cartoon TUTORIAL that teaches you everything you need to know to stream use your remote--easy breezy).When he wanted to try Netflix, he was able to EASILY click to install an app, then I *painfully* used a grid-keyboard to logon to Netflix account (username pwd) only ONCE and we were DONE.The voice search is SUCH a leap forward. It's incredible AND accurate. Can voice search by title, genre, director, actor, everything. And it even understands SOUTHERN. WooHooIt has 4 times the processing speed and 4 times the memory of our previous Roku box WOW what a difference in loadtime, resolution, quality of picture/vividness of color. Just awesome. What can I say Amazon did it again.Movie/Program descriptions are displayed at the bottom of the screen ( my ONLY quibbling complaint is you can't change the font size on descriptions w/o altering TV resolution, which I won't do). They do have excellent Closed Captioning functionality for those who need it you can enlarge the fonts there for easy readability.Basically, I'm very happy we took the plunge it really was a worthwhile improvement for us (we prefer Amazon's video streaming anyway--they have lots more documentaries than the other streaming services).I'm just sorry I waited so long : )---------Quick Update:Not all apps come preloaded on the device, though a ton of others did (Pandora, Bloomberg, Showtime Anytime, Netflix, Vevo, Vimeo, WatchESPN, Crackle, HuluPlus, iheartradio, and tuneinradio).IF you have an Amazon Kindle TABLET (I'm guessing like the HDX), you can somehow toss photos from the tablet directly to the Fire. Meaning, sitting in your living room, you can, apparently, swipe the photo across the screen and it lands on the Fire. (Don't have that, so can't DO that). HOWEVER, we do have many photos saved to Amazon's Cloud Drive they were all accessible from the FireTV console (via the TV, with just a click)--even a short family video we'd uploaded. With no interference from me. Just clicked on Photos there they were. EASY. A very nice feature.

I've been planning on getting a set top box for the past 2 years but just never found something that had everything I was looking for. Briefly browsing amazon a couple of weeks ago, I noticed they had their own recently release online media streaming device. After looking over the specs and capabilities, I thought it was about time to take the plunge - especially since we've been using Amazon Prime streaming services more and more now that our daughter watches kid shows (i.e. Dora, Umi Zumi, Blues Clues, etc.)Though we've only had it around a week, we're very happy with the purchase. We cut our cable over a year ago so plugging in the computer to the TV every time we wanted to watch something was beginning to get tiresome. Connection was straightforward and simple. On boot, it was automatically logged into our Prime account (not sure how it did this.)The interface is slick and really easy to find what you're looking for. It's very quick (not clunky) when browsing through video options and for some reason I think it looks better (could be mental, I know.) Another neat thing is that the remote doesn't have to have line-of-sight to the front of the box since it utilizes bluetooth. It's all about the simple things. Anyways, we're very happy with this little box.
I like the box but I'm on a wired network and overnight it looses the connection so the next day I have to unplug the Fire TV box and let it reboot to find the network again. I called customer service and they said they would look into it and get back - well, they never got back to me and it has been over two weeks. I like it when it works but I hate having to reboot the thing every time I want to watch it.
According to the info, the Paperwhite charges faster with the charger made for a Kindle but I think any brand will work. It came in a package deal when I bought my Paperwhite otherwise I would've skipped it used what I've been using for my old Kindle. I gave it 4 stars, because I like it, but feel it's overpriced.
Charger has worked well for charging my Voyage. Comes as a separate purchase from the Voyage which I found. Think it should be bundledwith the purchase price of the Kindle Voyage.
I'm very glad that I made this purchase. I don't often bring my computer with me when I travel. I enjoy having the option of using a standard outlet to charge the Paperwhite.
very overpriced!
My adaptor doesn't work. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but there are no instructions. It looks pretty simple. So it just simply doesn't work.
First rate - high quality!
Reliable and well-regulated for dual voltage (110-120v and 220-240v) without too much heat generation in Europe/Asia.
Too
Works great, just as expected. The Kindle doesn't need to charge very often, but I use this all the time for my phone. Nice to have a charger in more than one room.
This is the THIRD power charger that I have HAD to buy at cost of over 30 each since my Kindle Fire purchase. Why can't the chargers last a REASONABLE amount of time When I connected this charger, I received a message saying that it was a LOW level charger it probably would not charge while the Kindle was in use. NOT ACCEPTABLE for this cost!!!
Very expensive charger. I think the kindle should come with it as does all other tablets, including the fire, which is way cheaper and includes the charger for just 50. It is a pretty large charger though and doesn't fit in the kindle box with the kindle, at all.
Meet my needs but feel should be supplied when actually purchasing the Oasis E-Reader.
I do find this better than the cheaper version I bought initially at Staples. It charges faster but not as fast as the Kindle charger that I had used for a couple years before it finally gave out. Also, it is not possible to charge and still use your Kindle, something I was able to do with the previous charger, a feature I really miss. Still, better than the alternative.

These are great. This is my second Paperwhite and second charger. Thinking about a third, fourth...because while putting fiction on one and non-fiction on other have been thinking how great to have a Kindle dedicated just to recipes, another to health books etc would be marvelous

This. Is a great charger. I like it better than the square ones.
First rate - high quality!
To date, it's working fine. I'm hoping that it continues to work it's usually not the charger that goes bad for me though, it's the cord!
Over the years, I've tried a variety of cases for the various models of Kindle and Fire tablet that I've purchased from Amazon. While I've found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive, I found myself coming back to Amazon's own product when I purchased one of their new 7 Fire tablets, and I'm pleased with it.This is a very good quality cover, it fits well, and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation. It's made of fabric on the outside, with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed. It matches the color of the Fire tablet perfectly.My only hesitation in purchasing it was the price - the case all by itself is fully half the price of the Fire tablet! But I suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is, than how expensive the case is (kind of).Still, I decided to spend the money for this case. The tablet needs the protection and I know from experience that Amazon's cases are durable and will last for a long time (I've used my original Kindle Paperwhite - first generation model - with case since it was first purchased).I'll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet. I'm very satisfied with it.
I typically don't post reviews however don't waste your money on this case. I got it on Friday and started using it that evening. Its now Thursday and the case is peeling at the edges, the fabric around the camera hole has started bubbling, and the felt on the inside edge is wearing off. i have not had any issues with it standing on its own like other people have mentioned. I am giving this a two star mainly because it is still functional. I am tempted to send it back but I like the functionality of this case.
All good A+
This case is very well made and sturdy. It perfectly matches the color of the tablet. I cannot figure out how to use the back as a stand. There is only one way it folds so it should not be that difficult. It does not work for me so I have given it a 4 star review.
It's pretty and matches my Fire tablet and I like that it's slim and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the tablet. It could be improved if it had a hand strap to make holding it easier but I bought a separate hand strap that fits with it.
The case is cute and a nice color, fabric is nice, seems it will hold up. Problem is it doesn't stand up as described, mine doesn't stand up at all. Priced is too high for what it is in my opinion. I wouldn't buy this case again
Great new Light Weight cover/case for my new Canary Yellow Kindle. I wanted the case to match my new Kindle. What a great choice. I am so happy with both the case the Kindle. So bright cheerful. Just like a sunny day.
This case is great - it's inexpensive, slim and very sturdy! I have another Kindle Fire that's a little bigger so the case is somewhat heavy and bulky. in comparison - this case is very lightweight yet still protective.
This case is overall quite nice, but has started to peel apart on the edges a little. I will try to update this review later on after I see how it holds up.The tablet automatically locks, and wakes the screen when closing and opening the case, which I think is the most appealing part about this case.
This is a great cover. It turns the device on and off by opening and closing and works as a great stand with it either vertical or horizontal. It also adds very little to the size or weight of the tablet. I absolutely recommend it!
I can read a lot longer without pain in my hands since the cover holds it for me. Very nice shade of blue.
Nice case that my daughter needed for her new kindle she earned. Nice and sturdy. Its actually better than I thought it would be and serves its purpose.
All-New Amazon Fire 7 Tablet Case (7th Generation, 2017 Release), Charcoal BlackPerfect fit. I really like the case's simple clean design that lets you sit the tablet vertical and horizontal .
works well with the amazon fire 7
I bought this case at the same time I bought a new Fire tablet during Prime days. It was recommended on the tablet page, so I thought I was getting the right case. Well, it doesn't fit - not by a long shot. Then I realized the case was for a new Fire for 2017 (like mine) but 7th generation, not 8th. Since it does not fit, I now have to return it. And at my expense (arg!) I can't even exchange it for a new one because apparently Amazon does not make this case for the 8th generation Fire yet. You update one of your products, then release it, but you don't put out a case for it at the same time WTH Amazon When will you start selling Amazon cases for the Amazon Fire 8th generation I'm NOT happy with Amazon right now and am wondering whether I should keep the tablet if I can't get a case for it that has the vertical stand feature that the Amazon case has.
Fits greatly with the device and easy to use. The fabric makes it look cool.
Horrible cover for my new (third) Kindle!!! And it seems to be the only option for the Kindle Fire 7 (cover fits 7th generation). The back side of this cover folds like origami paper. It bends too many ways, is too lightweight, and won't prop up or stay propped up well. You can't stand it up to read on a table with any reliability. Forget it in a real wind or if it gets bumped.Amazon should have given us a choice between a sturdy cover with strong sides that don't bend all over and another, cuter, flimsier cover that can be bent as desired, like this one.Maggie
Still not really in love with the new Kindle itself (on the fence about returning it), but this case is just horrid. It says it stands, it doesn't. It just collapses no matter position it's in. It's flimsy and scratchy and does just about nothing. Complete waste of money.
This is a great case! It allows access to all ports and camera, while not taking from the protection of the tablet itself. It feels very durable, and I think it would protect the Fire well against accidental drops, bumps and scratches. As a blind individual, touch is very important to me. This product feels well made. It feels expensive, and I'm certain looks the same. The standing feature is great, it stands well for movie viewing or apps that do better in landscape. This is a great accessory for the new Fire 7. I'm sure there will be other companies making cases for it. But this is how the folks at Amazon envisioned their device, and it is amazing! Don't be fooled in to buying a cheaper product. Amazon devices do best with amazon accessories.
25 for a case for a product that costs 50. Typical scam from Amazon just a warning, in the process of returning both items seeing as the Fire 7 is a broken device. To transfer any data to it, you must restart replug the device for each file... even a 5 thumb drive can do more without an interface.
This works as a case, and matches the color of the kindle nicely. The main feature I wanted was the stand, however. It is only one corner flap, as pictured. I incorrectly assumed there might be slightly more technology involved. There is no stop or anything to keep it from going completely flat backward. Starting out, my kindle would sit at a nice 70 degree or so angle from the table, but now my kindle will sit at maybe 30 degrees off the table. Eventually it will just go flat. I've had it for maybe 3 weeks. If the stand feature is important to you, get a different case.
I liked the case but unfortunately I purchased the wrong one for my Kindle, my fault. Amazon, as usual, there was no problem getting a refund.
I'm loving my new Fire 7. I was looking for another Fire 6, and since it was not available and this 7 is only a little larger, comes in great colors, AND has Alexa - I was hooked and couldn't wait for it to arrive.
While this case fits a 7th Gen Fire perfectly, there is no comfortable way to hold it and it doesn't stand up on it's own for viewing. Returning to try another style
Good looking and works well. If you're having trouble standing it up vertically or horizontally check out Amazon's video (link below). My only slight quibble is that I find the Fire 7 slippery (it's fallen out of my hand) and I was hoping this case might have more of a grippy material.
Fits beautifully - snug and sweet.
Love the color of the cas and seems to protect well. Loving this case.
I got my first Kindle. This is a nice ebook reader. I'm going to jump right in and tell you what I found to be its Pros and Cons. Then I'm going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor, the Barnes Noble Nook Simple Touch.Kindle's Pros:Great Screen: Many people do not find LCDs hard to read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, Kindle Fire, Nook Color, etc.), but virtually everyone will find E-Ink easier to read, any time of day. Especially the newest E-Ink Pearl displays. They simply look like paper and ink. I have never experienced any eye strain reading E-Ink book readers, but I have with LCD based phone/tablet screens.Thin and Lightweight: This Kindle is thinner than any paperback and lighter too. This makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position, and for long periods too. It also makes it easy to transport in a purse, backpack, or messenger bag (or in luggage for traveling). Many people like to take a few books when travelling, and this Kindle lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden.Good Value: Even without a touchscreen, the Kindle is a good value. It is a well-made product, it offers cloud storage of your books (and well it should, since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add-in microSD card), the screen is excellent, Amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing. The Kindle 4 is the best value of Amazon's E-Ink readers. Some may be tempted to get the version with the built-in light. If you can afford it, sure, go ahead. But let me point out you don't have to spend 20 for a fancy-schmancy book light. Your local dollar store has them for ... wait for it ... a buck.Read more
I have owned a Kindle for several years now. I have had the 2nd generation Kindle and I have had the Kindle Keyboard. When my mom expressed interest in getting a Kindle I decided to give her my Kindle Keyboard because she doesnt have Wifi in her house and my older Kindle Keyboard had 3G, which is what she needed. And I decided to buy the Basic Kindle for myself because (1) I didnt want to wait for the Paperwhite to come out and (2) I just needed Wifi and (3)and most importantly I JUST WANT TO READ A BOOK, not listen to text-to-speach, or go shopping on Amazon, or listen to music, etc. All I want to do is read a book...thats it! This Kindle is perfect for that. Its smaller and lighter, the pages turn faster than the Keyboard version, it basically has everything I need to download a book and read a book with a much better price than the Paperwhite or Keyboard. Yes, you have to navigate through the keyboard on this kindle with a 5-way controller, but I rarely use the keyboard anyway. To download a book, I just search and buy books on my computer and send them to my Kindle...which is much quicker no matter what version of Kindle you have. So if you dont need, want, or use all the extras then I would definitely recommend the Basic Kindle for 69 with special offers, because who really pays attention to the screen savers anyway.
This is the third Kindle I have bought. I bought one for my Father and now this one is for my girlfriend. One little known feature of the Kindle is your get your own kindle.com email address when you buy one. You can use this email address to email books to yourself or to other people. I routinely download .mobi and .epub books online and email them to myself and to my Dad (and soon my girlfriend). Within seconds they will magically appear on your Kindle's home page.
I've had this a week now. I also have a Kindle Fire HD I have had for about a year, with the case on, the Fire HD is heavy. I love the HD, and never leave home with out it, but many times I wish I could just slip my books in my pocket and run. I go a lot of places on the run, take others places where I wait for them to shop or what ever, and there is not WiFi to play on my Fire HD. I just want to read. My reading time has come up from one book a year to 50 books a year, and now my reading will go up even more.This was the perfect answer. So feather light It is incredible. It is taking me a bit to not swipe the screen to turn a page, and get used to the lay out and use of the various buttons, but after an hour I had read the built in owners manual, learned the ins and outs of the buttons and had it set up. It connected to my WiFi instantly. The on screen key board has taken a bit to get used to but once you use it a few times you can do it pretty fast.I wondered how all my content, library of books would be transferred from my Fire HD, to this device. To my pleasant surprise after connecting to my Wi-Fi, the next time I looked at the home menu my entire library of over 300 books was there, archived. I just click a title and it down loads in seconds.I honestly can't tell the difference between the print on this and the print on my Fire HD. Pixel wise, my eyes can't differentiate a thing.I love the texture look of a page from a book look. The no glare is amazing. There are times and places I can't read or see the screen on my Fire HD, and this just runs circles around the reading in bright light. Yes!Read more
I've had this Kindle for a while now. Many of the reviews say it all so I don't think I could add much. But I feel like I need to speak on behalf of this Kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought. If this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it. So I have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us allDo you have any clue what you bought Let's all say it out loud: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!!!! It is an entry level model with no light. Amazon has always sold non lighted Kindles, and I still have many of them. They are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. Can you read a real book in the dark Of course not. So these non lighted Kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. It is ridiculous to buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. Read the product descriptions. This Kindle has no light, the Paperwhite and Voyage do.Scream all to the heavens: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!!!! To buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old Kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane. Could you not see when you clicked on BUY that this Kindle had no page turning buttons. Sometimes I think there are two kinds of Kindle owners: those who want page turning buttons and those who don't mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page. If you can tell by my sarcasm, I belong to the latter bunch.Then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is, are unable to sign on, and blame it on the Kindle. BAM! another 1 star review.Read more
As has been the case for years, Amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the Kindle. This one is no exception. If you've used a Kindle in the past, you're not going to notice much of a change with this one, but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth, I'll briefly go over them:*** SCREEN ***The new Kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray/off-white paper looking background. It's certainly not bright white, but it's also not LCD looking (dark gray.) It does NOT have buttons for page-turning as the older generations do. If you simply must have the page-turning buttons, please search for the older Kindles that offer that. One last thing regarding the screen: this is not a Kindle PaperWhite or Voyage where you have a back-lit screen... this has an unlit, off-white Kindle screen. I will say, the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than I've seen with previous generation Kindles and I believe that's because Amazon is using E-Ink's new Carta displays instead of the previously used Pearl displays. I love that and have been waiting for years for E-Ink, the Taiwan based company that makes the Kindle screens for Amazon, to improve them. It looks like they're finally getting it!The new Kindle's screen resolution is 167 ppi which is slightly lower than the Kindle PaperWhite which is 212 ppi, and substantially lower than the Kindle Voyage which boasts an impressive 300 ppi (individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye.) Price-wise though, the base model PaperWhite runs 99 at the time of this review, and the Voyage base model runs 199 so you can see, the more you pay, the better the resolution and features. 167 ppi is fine though...Read more
I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at 79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because 119 to 400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at 79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles. It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter. That's really annoying. Interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of Amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for 15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or 20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard, the previous version of Kindle, and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark.Read more
I travel for work. More and more, I find myself leaving the Kindle Fire at home and traveling with just an e-ink Kindle. So when I broke my Kindle 3, I decided to replace it with this entry level Kindle (without special offers).What's good:* Smallest, lightest e-ink Kindle available.* Still has the page turn buttons!* Like all the e-ink Kindles, this thing has amazing battery life.What's just OK:* Only 2GB memory. More is better. Then again, after two years of buying books I'm nowhere near filling this thing up.* Text entry using the 5-way switch works, but that's about all. I'm surprised it works well enough that I can't consider it a negative.What's not so good:* The lighted cover costs nearly as much as the Kindle! Anyone thinking of picking up this Kindle and the lighted cover should look at the new paper white models with integrated frontlight.The new Kindles look awesome. But they don't take anything away from this Kindle. It may not have some of the bells and whistles of the other models but it also costs quite a bit less. The Kindle is exactly what I need for traveling. It works wonderfully as a basic, no-frills e-reader. Reviewing it as such, I have to give it five stars.

I bought the first Kindle when it came out and, while I liked it, I didn't use it that much because the page turn buttons could be too easily triggered, and the cover was somewhat clumsy to use. The second generation Kindle was a lot better, but I still preferred to read physical books with the Kindle being a solution for being able to have books available without taking up any more space (I still buy physical books, but most are donated to the local library, Salvation Army, etc. after I've read them).Next, about a year after it came out, I bought what Amazon called the Kindle Keyboard and was hooked! I began using the Kindle as a preferred reading medium over physical books and thought that the Kindle Keyboard couldn't be improved upon (I've since given a couple as gifts). I liked the storage capacity, the 3G capability and thought I wouldn't want to be without the keyboard. After reading more than seventy books on it I couldn't imagine trying a Kindle with less memory and only Wi-fi.I was wrong.I ordered this 4th Generation Kindle earlier this year, thinking I'd have it for a backup to my Kindle Keyboard. Instead, it has become my much-preferred device. Storage room With the cloud, it's really not an issue. I keep a few reference books on both of my current Kindles (the Keyboard and this one) as well as what I'm currently reading. I haven't had any problem with coming close to exceeding the storage capacity. While it would be nice to have 3G, it's not a deal-killer at all. I've already read close to 50 books on this Kindle and I've only found myself without easy access to Wi-fi once. When I'm close to finishing a book, I plan ahead and download a new one (or two) so that I'm ready wherever I happen to be.Read more

Then I'm going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor, the Barnes Noble Nook Simple Touch.Kindle's Pros:Great Screen: Many people do not find LCDs hard to read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, Kindle Fire, Nook Color, etc.), but virtually everyone will find E-Ink easier to read, any time of day. Especially the newest E-Ink Pearl displays. They simply look like paper and ink. I have never experienced any eye strain reading E-Ink book readers, but I have with LCD based phone/tablet screens.Thin and Lightweight: This Kindle is thinner than any paperback and lighter too. This makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position, and for long periods too. It also makes it easy to transport in a purse, backpack, or messenger bag (or in luggage for traveling). Many people like to take a few books when travelling, and this Kindle lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden.Good Value: Even without a touchscreen, the Kindle is a good value. It is a well-made product, it offers cloud storage of your books (and well it should, since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add-in microSD card), the screen is excellent, Amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing. The Kindle 4 is the best value of Amazon's E-Ink readers. Some may be tempted to get the version with the built-in light. If you can afford it, sure, go ahead. But let me point out you don't have to spend 20 for a fancy-schmancy book light. Your local dollar store has them for ... wait for it ... a buck.Read more
UPDATE: December 12, 2012: I had purchased the new Kindle Paperwhite thinking it would be a vast improvement over this Kindle. Well I had mixed opinions on it. You might want to read my review of the Paperwhite here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z0SDFOCZ66Z6/refcmcrrdppermBottom line is that the Kindle 6 E-ink Display is for the money an amazing product. Unless you really do a lot of reading in bed or in dark rooms, you don't need the Paperwhite at nearly twice the cost. I actually returned my Paperwhite due to all the screen issues. My review of the Paperwhite describes all you need to know.UPDATE: September 17, 2012: New firmware is available for the Kindle. It is version 4.1.0 as I write this. It brings some notable improvements to the Kindle experience...New features in this update include:-Improved reading font that is higher contrast and crisper so that you can enjoy a paper-like reading experience.-Parental Controls that allow you to restrict access to the Experimental Web Browser, Archived Items, and the Kindle Store.-Support for books with complex layouts and formats with Kindle Format 8.-Support for children's books with Kindle Text Pop-Up and comic books with Kindle Panel View (which allows you to read a comic book panel by panel). Books that support these features will be available in the Kindle store over the next few weeks.-Dictionaries grouped into a collection in Home and Archived Items called Dictionaries for better organization.Improved table and image viewing (panning and zooming) on supported titles.The update is available from the Kindle Support area on amazon web site.And now, back to my original review...Read more
First off, I received my new Kindle this morning. I previously owned the Kindle Keyboard, but actually really didn't like the keyboard or the way the buttons were pressed together. I'm not a fan of touch screens so I bought this one.There are a few things to know about this particular Kindle that can help you decide if it's right for you...Here is a list of things to know about this Kindle.1. You'll be using an onscreen keyboard with the 5-Way Controller. This is not a problem for setting up WiFi and a little writing but if you are an avid note-taker or do a lot of writing with your Kindle, you might want to opt for the Kindle Keyboard.2. NO AUDIO - If you are planning on listening to audiobooks, Mp3s, or Text to Speech on your Kindle, this is not the device for you. There is not even a headphone jack, so there is absolutely no audio support.3. 2GB! This device has 2GB of storage, which is half of all the others... if you seriously need to keep over 1,400 books or so on your Kindle, you should opt for one of the others, all of which have 4GB. I only keep a hundred or so books on mine and the rest are up in the Amazon Cloud waiting for convenient download.4. There's no 3G version but the WiFi works just fine.5. There is a shorter battery life. Amazon reports the battery life is only one month of reading, compared with the others that clock in at two months. If you are going to be away from electricity for over a month, first of all RESPECT!, second of all, you may want a Kindle that has the 2 month battery life.6. It's lighter than all the other versions. It weighs in at just under 6oz (170g). The closest competition is the Kindle Touch which is about 7.5oz.7. It has 5 buttons on the face at the bottom.Read more
Having been a little overwhelmed by the choices between all the new Kindles and which one to get, I ordered this new basic 79 Kindle first to take for a spin. So far, I like what I see. I also own a Kindle 3 so that's the only device I can really compare it to at this time (I think a comparison between other tablets and this Kindle is meaningless, this device is all about content and delivery):1. Form-factor - Compared to the Kindle 3, this Kindle feels more compact, lighter and easier to hold. My hands wrap around this better than K3. Reading books for a few hours at a stretch will be easier on this device compared to the K3. It is the lightest such device I have used compared to all previous Kindles and other tablets.2. Screen - I personally like the fact that there are no keys on the device and that keys come up on the screen when you need them. Delivers a better overall reading experience. However, navigating through the on-screen keyboard with the 5-way controller can be taxing if you need to do a lot of searching, and you might miss the full physical keyboard. I hardly search on the Kindle itself, I search for books on my laptop so this is a non-issue.3. Price! - At 79, you can't go wrong. Compared to buying paperback or hardcover editions, you will recover the cost of this in a matter of a few months because most Kindle content is priced cheaper than print editions (and you get it instantly, and can access it wherever you are). Not to mention all the free Kindle downloads available in the catalog.4. Display - almost the same E-ink display at the K3. No glare no reflection. You can sit in bright sunlight and read it just like a book. Page turns seem a lot faster on this compared to the K3.Read more
This is a good case that provides adequate protection for your new 8 inch 2017 Kindle Fire. Inside it features a plastic frame that you snap your Kindle into. The frame solidly holds your Kindle into place and also covers the corners of the tablet and protects it during drops. The case weighs in at 4.66 ounces.The exterior of the case is a fiber cover that looks stylish. It is available in canary yellow, charcoal black, cobalt blue, marine blue and punch red. The one in my video is marine blue. The top cover has magnets in it that hold the cover closed and also tightly attach it to the back surface of the case when the cover is fully opened.The cover also has magnets in it that turn off the tablet when you close the cover and turn it on when you open the cover. I like that feature as it helps to conserve battery power. The inside surface of the cover is a micro fiber material and that protects your tablet screen from scratches when the cover is closed.I like that the micro SD card slot is covered when the tablet is installed in the case. That helps to protect the SD card from being lost or quickly stolen. A large memory size SD card can cost 47 to almost 100 and the added security is helpful.The tablets speakers are uncovered when the tablet is opened and when it is properly stood up in the landscape mode so you can watch a video. I show this in my product video. All of the top controls and ports are available while the tablet is in the case. That includes the volume controls, the headphone jack, the microphone, the power charging port and the power on/off button.The cover flap can be partially folded to allow you to stand the tablet into the portrait mode or in the landscape mode for reading, browsing the Internet or watching movies.Read more
This is a horrible an overpriced case. I've had this case for less than two weeks and it's already coming apart. The little rubber stitching around the case is falling off
As with other recent Fire covers by Amazon, the cover has a snap-in plastic shell that holds the Fire securely and will not let it fall out. (I've used plastic shells similar to this for years with my Kindles and Kindle Fires, and none of them has ever slipped out.)Another feature that I look for is Auto Wake/Sleep, which automatically wakes the tablet when you open the cover and puts it to sleep when the cover is closed. It's a very useful feature that helps to extend battery life, since you don't have to remember to hit the power switch when you close the cover. It's also a huge convenience feature.Other comments:* All of the Fire's ports and controls are on top of the Fire, which is open on the case. The speakers are covered, but when the case is opened, they're uncovered. Note that the cover does block the micro SD card port on the side.* The microfiber inside of the top cover helps prevent scratches to the display screen.* The front cover can be folded to act as a viewing stand. It's a nice feature, especially for watching videos.* With the cover folded back on itself, the rear camera is blocked. To use the camera, you'll have to keep the cover open. But honestly, how often are you going to use the Fire's rear camera, which at 2 MP is pretty lame.
I have purchased several Amazon Fire cases in the past and have been delighted in the streamlined design and the vinyl covering. Very easy to keep clean. This new design for the fire HD 8 is FABRIC. How long do you imagine a yellow fabric cover is going to stay clean I cannot see any easy way to clean it, like I do with the vinyl covers. I bought one for myself as well as my Mother. I will keep them but I sure hope they don't turn around and produce vinyl ones after all the concerns I am sure will be coming. I won't be able to afford two more.
Has the basics covered: Secure hold, access to all ports, camera etc. Folds flat and holds magnetically if you want to read, but dangles freely if you want to use the camera. Feels secure.Better than expected: Other Kindle cases have been a bit insecure when used as stands, especially in portrait mode. This one is quite secure.Worse than expected: The textured front cover looks fine and feels nice but any slight stain from kids' food crumbs and the like stains immediately and due to the texturing cannot be wiped off. Even a bristled brush left some noticeable residue on the pale yellow one. Word of advice - unless you are both an OCD neat freak and very careful where you put this thing down, go for a darker color. Expensive - what do you expect for a new captive device
I like the case for the primary reason that I bought it--to protect my new kindle, but as a stand it has its drawbacks. I am not comfortable at all with trying to use it in the vertical position, and in the horizontal it is stable enough for watching movies or videos, but at home I have another stand that I use if I am playing any of my games on the tablet. Good price, and I am pleased with it as protection for my tablet. Not near as pleased with it as a viable stand.
1. While a great idea to make the cover self-standing, it's annoying that it's floppy when not in use.2. I bought the cover because my first Kindle didn't have a cover and often got left on, wearing down the battery. My second Kindle cover had the convenient feature of automatically opening and closing the device. So I wanted that feature on my third Kindle. Even though I think it's over priced, I like the convenience.3. My other cover was black, which often got lost on dark surfaces. This time I got the denim blue, so it's much easier to find from a distance.
Fits well, the easel stand is a little flimsy and the Cobalt Purple is really blue, but for protection it works well.
The case does what it is supposed to do. I think because I bought the tablet, Amazon should have reduced the price of case. Too pricey but I wanted a perfectly fitted case and not something that would or would not be compatible.
it's a nice color, it fits the fire8 very well, however, i cannot stand it on it's side, unless I reverse the fire8, and put the right side on the bottom. The stand does not work on it's left side the way the diagram shows.
My primary concern is the price when comparing to other solutions. Nevertheless, has received the and installed the product I believe that I meets my specific needs and expectation. This case is unlikely to protect my Fire HD in a 5-foot drop. It does, however, protect my kindle from spills and low drops. What I want and what I have is the ability to, without forethought, turn off the Kindle when the cover is closed to save power. Moreover, whether by design or oversight the fact that the SD Card is covered (e.g. you need to remove the case to access the SD slot) this is a good thing. All in all I am impressed with product 's fit (e.g. the camera hole is perfectly aligned.), the tablet speakers are well positioned for audio and the case folds into both landscape and portrait support positions,Bottom-line I'm happy with the purchase and can recommend it to others for consideration.
I've had the new Fire HD 8 with the case for about a week. I use it exclusively for reading and listening to audiobooks. So far my only issue with the tablet is the volume drops when the cover is closed. Why is that There is no reason I can think of why my volume needs should change because I closed the lid. BTW, the marine blue is lovely. The speakers are located along the left side of the device so when you close the table case the sound quality which is already mediocre, is noticeably diminished. This is a design flaw that needs to be fixed. I purchased this tablet to replace an impaired ipad mini. For the price, the Fire tablet is a reasonable replacement.
As a Kindle case, this works, but it's got a few too many negatives.To the good, it's nice and thick, meaning it gives good protection, and your Kindle snaps into it rather than just sitting in it like my 7 HDX's magnetic case, meaning your Kindle won't fall out if you tip it too far.However.1. I hate the flap this has for propping it up. Maybe I was spoiled by my last Kindle's case, but I had one of the magnetic origami ones, and the case folded into a very solid support that would hold the Kindle up on either of the long sides. This one's flap isn't magnetic, and it's just one diagonal fold, which makes gives far less support. The thing tips over or collapses more than I'd like it to, and if I want to read in landscape orientation (i.e. the long sides go left to right rather than up and down), the top and bottom aren't interchangeable. That wouldn't normally be a problem, but...2. There's a camera on the back of the Kindle 8, and the case has a hole for it. The problem is, there's only one hole, which means there's a right way and a wrong way to put the Kindle into it. Like I said, none of this would normally be a problem, except I sometimes use it while it's charging, and my outlet is on the left side of the bed. Naturally, the stand puts the USB thing on the right side of the Kindle. Assuming I don't want to cover the camera, I can either prop it up while I read, or let it charge while I read, but not both. (I'll probably order a longer USB cable, but the one the Kindle comes with is too short to wrap around to the other side.) I wish they'd punched two holes in the back and given us options for which direction the Kindle fits.3. It's got a canvassy sort of fabric covering rather than a hard plastic one like my last case.Read more
Good cover love the standing feature, one big flaw.... It need cut outs for the speakers when shut....Music still plays when active and cover closed to protect screen but there are no cut outs for the speakers thus destroying the sound..... This is a huge design flaw for the case.
In this day and age of rectangles with screens being covered in various ways, its perplexing that you can mess up something as basic as this. It covers the Fire fine. The fit is snug and snaps into place no problem. A hidden magnet auto-wakes/sleeps the display when you open/close it. The fabric collects cat hair like a pair of cheap black pants. Yet worst of all is the fold on the back does an awful job of propping up fire when you want to use it hands free. You can get it to stay, but it often slides out, or just puts the fire at a slightly weird angle. Whether it's in portrait or landscape orientation, the stand on the back is so wonky, that you're better off just using a jar of peanut butter and a couple pieces of chewing gum to get it to stay in place.
Over the years, I've tried a variety of cases for the various models of Kindle and Fire tablet that I've purchased from Amazon. While I've found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive, I found myself coming back to Amazon's own product when I purchased one of their new 8 Fire HD tablets, and I'm pleased with it.This is a very good quality cover, it fits well, and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation. It's made of fabric on the outside, with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed. It matches the color of the Fire tablet perfectly.My only hesitation in purchasing it was the price - the case all by itself is nearly half the price of the Fire tablet! But I suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is, than how expensive the case is (kind of).Still, I decided to spend the money for this case. The tablet needs the protection and I know from experience that Amazon's cases are durable and will last for a long time (I've used my original Kindle Paperwhite - first generation model - with the Amazon leather case since it was first purchased).I'll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet. I'm very satisfied with it. Notice how the speakers are visible at the top of the tablet when it is propped up in landscape mode.
When I purchased my Kindle Fire HD 8, this was the recommended case at checkout. I purchased it thinking that an Amazon sourced cased should work and fit well. I'm very happy with my choice of this case both with its style/look and function. The price is much lower than that of the case in which I keep my Kindle Paperwhite but is still fairly expensive given the cost of the Fire.To my match my black Kindle Fire, I chose the charcoal black version which is actually a tweed style look in various shades of gray and black. It has the look and feel of fabric versus the plastic covers I have used on my Paperwhite. The inside is a black microfiber cloth for screen protection. It does not have an internal pocket. My Kindle Fire fits securely in the plastic shell and can stand both landscape and portrait with a flip of the case.The case has a magnetic cover which keeps it shut or open without the front cover having to be held manually in place. Whether the case is open or closed, the ports for charging, the MicroSD port and headphones as well as the control function buttons are exposed. When it is closed, the cover covers the speakers and the front facing camera lens. When the cover is fully open and folded to the back, the rear camera lens is covered (the front facing lens is fully exposed when the case is open.) If you wish to use the camera for photos or video while it is in the case, you can hold the front cover in your off-hand while it is in use.As I have a tendency to leave my Paperwhite on (and run down the battery fairly regularly), I appreciate that this cover automatically turns itself off and on when you close or open it.
This is an improvement over the Origami case we purchased for my husband's old 2013 Fire 7. He liked the case but the way it would collapse into several sections when trying to close was frustrating for me. This one has only 2 sections, so the folding issue is very minimal and it stands up well in both landscape and portrait as long as the tablet is in the correct orientation. (Just give the tablet a 180 if you can't get it to stand.) I don't usually like blue, but the marine blue of this cover and the tablet is gorgeous and they match perfectly. There is a nice texture to it that helps immensely with the grip as well as being very attractive. The cutouts are precise and allow for charging without removing the cover. I often have difficulty with close fitting hard plastic cases, but I had no trouble removing this one when I needed to. The only downside is that it does pick up a bit of lint at times. Overall, a very nice, classic case.
The Fire HD 8 seemed like a great deal to me considering the size, economical price point, and the ability to watch content offline. And it offered exactly that...but fell short on performance parameters. If you're price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet, larger screen than the 6 Fire, and the ability to watch content offline, this is a decent device to get. However, if you already have an earlier Kindle like the HDX 8.9 or even an earlier version of the Fire, I recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn't really be a worthwhile upgrade. I have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device. If you're looking for a very basic tablet to watch videos or for your kids, the 49.99 Fire is a better option.QUICK SUMMARY:PROs - Price, dual stereo speakers, expandable memory slot (great for viewing content offline), full access to Amazon content. Good basic tablet specially for watching videos.CONs - Screen resolution crisp but not great, lags quite a bit when switching or starting/closing apps (runs fine once an app is open), battery life is just ok, freezes quite often and the only solution is to reboot the device which becomes frustrating after a while.The device is basically slow to load apps, lags quite a bit when switching apps (this becomes worse as you load more content on the device), freezes quite often, and I find myself having to reboot it every now and then. A frustrating experience to say the least. The device is claimed to be Designed for Entertainment - true, but I would also add Not designed for performance.This is meant to be a basic value tablet giving you access to the Amazon ecosystem, and it is exactly that.Read more
Let me make things simple for everyone. This is a great tablet and a beautiful device. It has everything 97 of tablet users need and want. The 3 that are power users can pay up for an iPad.Amazon Prime is a must if you have one of these tablets. And if you already have Amazon Prime it is a no-brainer to buy this tablet if you are looking for an entertainment device that also gives you the ability to check email and surf the web as needed.People complain that one app here or there is missing. If you want the tried and true, the basics, then you have nothing to worry about. Of course there is a weather app. Of course there is a NYT app. All the 'normal' stuff is there. Sure, a particular game or more specialized app may not be available but anything most people actually 'want/need' is going to be there.This is not a device for the office. If you want to review spreadsheets then clearly do not buy it. That goes without saying.As for the actual device it feels well put together. The plastic back actually felt closer to metal to me. It has a solid feel. The screen is beautiful and has PLENTY of resolution for watching movies, surfing the web, etc. It is also sufficient for reading, though the Kindle Paperwhite admittedly has clearer print so if you only plan to read on this device then get the Paperwhite. (Also, I find the Word Runner feature to be quite intriguing- in fact I think we all may read using this method in a few years.)Before buying the device I read that load times are slow and switching between apps is trouble. What I have found is that it may take a second for your movie or app to load...but we are talking a second...or two MAX! If you can't wait two seconds for something then I don't know what to say.Read more
As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing my first impressions of the Fire HD 8 from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the Paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9 (3rd and 4th generation). Here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new Fire HD8.Amazon removed the Fire HD7, the Fire HDX7 and the Fire HDX8.9 and replaced them with the Fire HD (7 screen), Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10.HARDWARE:WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: The HD8 Fire, a short USB cord and a power adapter. Finally, Amazon ships a power adapter with their Fires so you can charge and use the device right out of the box. (Picture attached)SIZE: The HD8 is longer than the older HD7 but the same width as the discontinued HD7. It is also thinner. (8.4x5.0x0.3 versus 7.5x5.0x0.4). I have large hands and can hold it with one hand, but even with my hands, I really need to use both hands. Because it is longer, it seem top heavy to me. The back is also slick and slippery to hold. Mine has a habit of sliding off the table.Display: The resolution of the screen is 1280 x 800 same as the HD 7 but the pixel density is lower due to the longer screen length. In practical use, though, you can't tell the difference. The display is nice and bright but barely readable in bright sunlight. One nice touch is that now, you can choose your own wallpaper! It comes with 9 stock images and if you don't like one of them, you can choose your own image in your Amazon Photos folder.Read more
I am extremely pleased with this case. Though lightweight it is well constructed and crafted in a way so that it protects the Kindle from bumps and bruises and it also will protect the screen if the Kindle happens to fall on its face. This is a great buy and I highly recommend if you want to keep your Kindle safe from harm
I bought this along with a fire tablet I purchased for my 9 year old. Fits great and does the job well as she has already dropped the tablet a few times. I would recommend this for anyone buying a fire tablet for their kids.
Great purchase nephew loved it.
Very protective case but highly over priced piece of molded foam.
Perfect for my 4 year old son, he is so rough on things and this protects his kindle well.
Super sturdy and easy for little hands to hold.
Super cool!
Great case. Fits kindle fire perfect.
I brought this for my 5 year old GranAngel she loves it the size is just right! The child proof case is ideal for her.
Great for kids. Makes it easy for them to hold the fire and great protection for when it drops. Nothing protecting the screen though but so far that hasn't been an issue.
This is the third one I bought every kids fire tablet needs one.

My niece was used to carrying around my tablet with a handle on the case. This one is not good for toddler to handle
I had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. But, keep in mind that this is not an iPad or typical Android tablet. This is an Amazon media and shopping machine. It is well built, has good battery life, reasonably fast and responsive, dual band wifi, SD card slot, decent display and so-so camera. No tablet is going to give you awesome sound, but I was surprised at how well the two speakers sound on this tablet. No tablet it going to give you a great camera, and this tablet is probably on the lower end of the spectrum - it works, but it won't be your go-to camera for important shots. This tablet excels at playing Amazon content - music and video. It is a great reader, although a little heavy compared to a Kindle device. It makes shopping easy - perhaps too easy. The OS is based on Android, but don't look for Google Play or Google apps in general - this is nothing like an Android tablet. Finally, you can't beat the price. I think Amazon wants to get these in the hands of as many people as possible. I would have given this 4.5 stars if that option was available. I didn't give it 5 stars only because it is not a general purpose tablet. This is a dramatic improvement over the Fire 7. The integration of Alexa is flawless and works very well - depends on whether or not you have an Echo and on how you feel about that product. I have an Echo and find it useful (not essential but useful). I find myself using Alexia on this tablet more than I thought I would.
All right so I was scrolling through the reviews and read some pretty ridiculous reasons to not give this tablet five stars. One such was that the tablet weighed a whole 3 oz more and that resulted in a 3 star review. Let me start off by saying if that is the reason for giving a crap review that is ridiculous. It says the tablet weight depends on the manufacturing. The other funny one is that someone is upset with the special offers on the front screen. That's why you get a cheap and good tablet. It even says in the discription that there will be ads on the lock screen. It takes a second to swipe up and unlock the screen. So the bad reviews are just reviews by people looking to nit-pick.This tablet is exactly what Amazon was describing. It is cheap, looks good, loads apps quickly, expandable storage, good speakers, decent screen and all while staying under 80 bucks.The start up didn't take long and it came preloaded with my account on it. For 80 dollars this is a good buy and the complaints on the wieght and the ads are ridiculous reasons to give this tablet a shabby review.Buy this tablet if you want a cheap e-reader that can also sure the web, watch movies and shows, check Facebook or Twitter, or read books on. Ignore the negative reviews and you won't be disappointed.
First, let me say that this is my first Fire tablet. I've previously had either iPad's or Android tablets. I was skeptical at first because I've generally only liked iPad's, but I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I paid full price for this product and am not being compensated in any manner to post this review.Let's just jump right to the Pro's and Con's shall wePro's:FastAmazing Screen resolutionGreat soundResponsiveAlexa is kind of awesomeBattery life. OMG! I've charged it once so far, I've watched YouTube videos on it, streamed a movie and a few TV shows and I use it for Facebook and I'm not even half way down on the battery after 3 days. Wow!The OS. The operating system is simple, responsive, and beautifully done. Everything is easy to find and it's really easy to navigate.Con's:Only one Con...Charge port. The charge port is sticky and doesn't seem as high quality.Overall this is a fantastic tablet and worth so much more than the price. I LOVE IT!
So happy with my new fire and I wish I had bought more! Some of the PROS of this tablet are it has Alexa, Memory expansion slot, and a nice size. At 8 inches it is the perfect size to take on the go and Ebook . It is a little thicker than some of the more expensive tablets on the market but because of this it seems more durable especially for kids. The apps and games seem to run smoothly and the colors are good on screen. I install the Google Play store and Connect to the google play store to download apps is easy, like youtube. Without the Google Play store you will stuck with the Amazon store and apps.I often use the tablet to watch videos with my meidong E6 bluetooth headphones Meidong E6ANC Bluetooth Headphones Active Noise Cancelling Headphones Wireless Stereo headphones with Microphone, Ergonomic Design for Kids Adult-Black this is a excellent headphones with noise cancelling at an affordable price if you are looking for, this is right for you. And it has two colors for choice, black and rosegold,I have bought two. I did some research and found that the meidong company is an audio electronics innovator specializing in bluetooth/ANC headphones, vibration speakers,wifi speakers. No wonder their headphones sound really nice, also recommend.Back to here,The only 1 CONS I would say about that The tablet has two camera, rear is 2mp and front is 0.3mp, very very basic. Having two speakers but the speaker is not great.Overall, it is a good value for the price,This tablet can do whatever other tablets those cost twice or triple the price do.
Let me start by saying I purchased this item from my local Best Buy store for the same price here on Amazon (plus tax) but I feel that more people read Amazon reviews so I wanted to leave my review here. Now, I didn't expect this to be an amazing tablet, but people were generally saying it was snappy enough. I wanted a media tablet. Something I could use late at night to watch YouTube videos or an episode of my favorite show while laying in bed. I also like it for online shopping so I don't have to hold a laptop but am not looking at my phone screen.PROS:Tablet exceeded my expectations. It's great for media. I use this more than my phone and my laptop now.It's snappy, I was able to complete my homework for online classes, watch videos from CNN and other tasks without too much struggleIt can be a general purpose tablet. HEED MY WARNING doing the following may void your warranty with Amazon, I'm not sure. But I installed the Google play store on my fire HD 8 and now have access to a huge selection of apps. I decided to do this after finding there was no good YouTube app from Amazon's app store. Because fire OS is basically Android with a heavy skin on it, everything runs perfectly as you can see from the pictures.SOUND IS FANTASTIC!!!! Did I say that loud enough Yes they are still tablet speakers, no they won't fill your whole room with bumping bass but MY GOSH these are some GOOD tablet speakers. Better than my 900 smartphone, 1000 laptop and 500 iPad. What I'm trying to say is, the speakers are way better than the price point would suggest. Bravo Amazon.CONS:Ram is lacking. Doesn't excel in multitasking, drops tasks while you're away even if it was the last thing you were doing. It does this randomly however, and it's not always a problem.Read more
I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more
If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more
For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more

For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more
I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more

If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions.

I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line.

This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones.

If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more
For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great!

I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more

This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more
For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more

I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more

If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line.

I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more

For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more
I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading).
I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa.
I love everything about this case except for how it fits on the Echo Dot. I was expecting a snug fit however, it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it (and the power cable is disconnected), the dot will fall out of the case.
Major fan, didn't buy this because of protection, bought it cause it will blend in to my decor. It is not a skin, so it's not skin tight. Yes it's loose but how often will you grab it and move it. Me maybe once every year.
Like a previous reviewer mentioned it is fabric over hard plastic it is not a snug or tight fit. Good quality though.
Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen. There has to be something I can do. I looked and search and what I found is the Fabric Case for Alexa. This is it! A support she will be happy to wear. No more accidental popping out, no more shifting and readjusting, she is finally safe.
Changes the whole look of the Echo ... after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather. But blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk! The texture is also really nice feel and look to it!
A great looking cover for the Echo Dot. It gives the Dot a softer and more elegant look. I feel that it is a little pricy for what you get but I do not regret my decision to buy this case.

This is perfect. A lot of people were commenting that the case falls off and it's not portable. That's not the intended use of the case. It is strictly for decorative use. It look great and comes in several color options. Would definitely purchase again.
Fits perfect on the new Fire 8 kids tablet!! Thanks so much for another great product!
This is my second fire and case. I love both even though I have not dropped my device I feel confident with the thick foam surrounding it would survive if I did.
Very sturdy
Great product and really protects the tablet.
Perfect
Great sturdy case perfect for my three year old!
Works great to protect the Kindle from drops.
Good case!!
A gift for my granddaughter.
This thing does it's job perfectly, it's light weight and provides great protection. Not worried about it when in the little ones hands (or not as the case may be)!
I am happy in having this good things.
Perfect! Got this in addition to the new 16gb tablet when it was released and my son loves it and if it drops it is well protected. Thanks Amazon
As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing my first impressions of the NEW Fire HD 8 released on September 21, 2016 from the perspective of being a long-term Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the Paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9 (3rd and 4th generation), the old Fire HD 8 and the Fire HD 10. Here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new Fire HD8.Amazon has replaced the original HD 8 released in 2015 with an All-New HD 8. Amazon is also removing the Fire HD6, which is a shame as it is a great little tablet.The new HD 8 differs from the old version as follows:BEST NEW FEATURE:The price has been reduced! The 16 GB version of the old device cost 169.99 with special offers (ads). The new 16 GB version costs 89.99 and you can get a 32 HB version for 30 more.SECRETLY REMOVED:Amazon has removed the ability to mirror your display on Miracast devices such as TVs. Now that feature is now only available on generation 4 and 5 Fires including last years HD 8. However, you can still cast Prime videos to a FireTV or Fire Stick.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX:The HD8 Fire, a short 3-foot USB cord and a power adapter so you can charge and use the device right out of the box.SIZE:The new HD8 is a fraction thicker than the 2015 HD8. Leather cases for the old HD 8 will fit the new HD 8 but hard shell cases will not. However the auto wake feature of some older cases won't work.One complaint I had about the earlier versions was that the back was very slick and slippery to hold without a case.Read more
I am thrilled with the new Fire HD8 - even before it gets Alexa! At that time I will likely be ecstatic! I am far from a tablet novice - I had the original fire the 50 fire the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and the Galaxy Tab S 10.5. My phones have always been Samsung flagship phones, currently the S7 Edge. I say this to show that I 1) have experience with kindle fires, and 2) generally tend to have high standards for my most used devices -- I KNOW what is a good tablet and what is a so-so tablet. Admittedly, my previous fires have been so-so, but I wanted something inexpensive yet adequate to take places with me instead of my Galaxy Tab S 10.5.My HD8 is the 32gb option, with offers. Most users will likely be fine with 16gb and perhaps an added 32gb or 64gb SD card. However, I know how I use my devices, so went with the 32gb option, as well as a 64gb micro SD card. In the 48 hours I have had my new Fire, it has become my device of choice, even over my 500 samsung (more convenient size). I use the large samsung tablet as a computer replacement whereas the new Fire replaces my two 7 inch tablets as the go to device.Before receiving it, I wasn't sure about the low resolution (1280 x 800) on this tab, but honestly, it's not a problem! Sure, it's not bright and beautiful like my Tab S ... but its crisp, clean, and clear. The colors are sufficient, but not vibrant, sadly. (The comparison photo below is the HD8 (2016) and Fire 7 (2015).Sound is quite good, with good volume. The speakers are on the left side when portrait, on top (or bottom) in landscape. I prefer them on top. The sound is good enough that you can enjoy a movie without having to use earphones, unless in a noisy environment, in which case you would likely want to use earphones anyway.Read more
First off,i appreciate you reading this review :) Just so you get a little background on me, we are major tech users. We have multiple tablets from apple,samsung,and asus. This fire tablet is comparable in a different way. This tablet uses a amazon based operating system, Fire os. So no play store or itunes... As a prime member however, this tablet is an incredible value because you get instant access to all of your prime benifits. Ive had a chance to really put this product thru its paces over the past 2 days. I ordered 2 of these tablets so me and my wife could really put these to use. We have Gone thru 3 full power cycles (fully charging and fully draining the battery thru use) it does get 10-11 hours of hefty use so battery life is a plus! This tablet is a keeper. Screen looks fantastic. Colors seem to be just slightly dull however the resoloution for everyday use is perfect for this price point. Speed is snappy enough for basic use and handles more complex tasks and games without much issue. On a passmark benchmark test i got a score of 3377. However the second HD 8 constantly grades about 30-35 points lower. So it is a possibility that even tho you have the same exact tablet,they might be built slightly different so performance will vary. At this price point I didnt expect them to come out exactly the same. This tablet is bassically the same specs as the samsung tab a at half the price! Oh and the hd 8 actually offers a slightly better resoloution then the samsung! Minus one star for the wifi connection. I have lost connection several times on both tablets. Seems to only happen on my 5g connection.Also the screen being so reflective,it is impossible to use at all outdoors.also sadly is a fingerprint magnet.Read more
We got this the day it came out. I have a four year old daughter, and she loves it! We have an iPad for her, but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them. This tablet restricts all in app purchasing. Yay! We tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well. But so far, this one works well. I have two requests to Amazon, and I am hoping that someone from Amazon reads my review so they can make this change. Please change Amazon Freetime so that it puts the story apps that are under apps into the books sections. There are many wonderful stories that are read out loud but they are in the apps section instead of the books section, so then when I restrict her tablet to books only, she can't access them. I would love it so much if you they would fix this. A few examples of the stories she can't access when I restrict her to books because they are considers apps are the following: Nighty Night!, Charlie Brown's, The Berenstain Bears, and Dino-Store Story. The other recommendation I have is to please hide from view the activities that are restricted. As it is now, she can see all the apps but gets an error message when she selects them. I really like this product, and I think it so great for children. It just needs a few little improvements to the Freetime interface.
I feel like a lot of the bad reviews are from people who do not know what they are doing, or don't fully understand how to use the tablet to its full potential. This tablet DOES allow you download any app that you would find on the play store! Because of the parental features you have to first download them on YOUR PARENT PROFILE FIRST!! I love that about this tablet. Also, I can block the camera AND web browser so my child can't access that either! I can put a pass code on pretty much everything like profiles, WiFi access, settings, etc. It's really easy to set up and it came almost fully charged so I had plenty of time download what I wanted for my daughter and set it all up before I had to put it on the charger... It does, however, take a bit long to complete charge to 100, but no big deal. This is a great tablet so far and we are thoroughly enjoying it :)
June 18 is not only the Father's Day but also my older daughter's birthday. She turns 6 years old this year and we thought that tablet would be a nice birthday gift for her. Her younger sister has Fire 7, so it was logical for us to buy Fire 8 for her, as she's older.We bought this tablet for her more with an educational purpose, than to watch cartoons. My husband is a software engineer and he really wants our daughter to learn how to code. There are so many different apps for that.We have already tested it today, when the tablet arrived, but haven't shown it to our daughter yet.There are three different colors and we chose the blue one, as it's her favorite color. It's very bright, the case looks like removable foam shell, very sturdy and easy to grab. It's actually a very nice decision of adding yellow color because when brother and sister share one device, it's better to go neutral.There is a possibility to expand storage up to 256 Gb, but I think 32 Gb on board will be more than enough for my daughter.Big cutouts make it easier to access to the volume and power buttons, as well as the charging port and headphone jack.The display is ok for the price. When I watched Peppa Pig, images looked sharp and colors were vibrant, even at extreme angles. The sound is much better here than in Fire 7 Kids Edition, and that's due to dual stereo speakers.I don't know how easy and intuitive the interface will be for our daughter, but for us it was great, nothing odd or unnecessary. My favorite option is Parent Control. I can password-protect purchases (including in-app purchases), Wi-Fi access and more.Read more
The Fire HD 8 kids tablet is essentially an HD 8 with the kids cover, FreeTime, and a 2 year warranty. Lots of improvements over the previous kids edition tablet such as dual band wifi, higher quality 720p screen, Dolby stereo speakers, double the storage, and increased battery life.The kids cover allows your little one to get a good grip on it and also provides exceptional protection from drops. The IPS screen has excellent viewing angles, vibrant colors, and offers plenty of brightness indoors. However once you move outside the screen will wash out if you're in the sun. The dual speakers give you true stereo sound and offer plenty of volume. It's a shame that the cameras don't offer higher resolution, but none the less the rear cam does take a decent picture even if your hands aren't that steady. Should you fill up the internal storage you can add up to a 256GB microSD card.FreeTime has a wealth of content, and it includes a kid-safe web browser that will only load sites that are whitelisted by you or Amazon. If you don't want your child using the browser then it can be turned off. You can also restrict access to certain categories, set time limits, and view what your children are watching and reading with the Parent Dashboard. After the first year there is a nominal fee to continue using the service.Tips:- You can view Amazon videos offline when not connected to wifi. Switch to your adult profile and download the video(s). Now go into settings, profiles and family library, select your child profile, add content, videos, and select your videos.- You can sideload Google Play and gain access to even more apps such as YouTube Kids.- You can set FreeTime to only allow entertainment content after daily educational goals have been met.
I bought 2 of these for christmas presents and I have to say they aren't very kid friendly. Every kindle I've had in the past has been pretty easy to use, this one has a lot of options that I think could be elsewhere to make it easier for a child to navigate. They have an easier time using the other devices (kindle fire, or kindle app on their other tablets) which is unfortunate because I wanted them to be able to have something strictly for reading. Also for a kids bundle its very disappointing that most children's books don't work with this device. No where on the kids bundle page does it state this is an 8th generation kindle. Now, I have a few kindles and have bought new ones as they come out, but I haven't followed close enough to know this is an 8th generation without that information available on the page. I planned on buying these devices so bought a bunch of books listed as available for e-readers 5th generation. I assumed since it was the latest one listed, and my new devices didn't have anything listed, it was the latest. I just found out today that its an 8th generation and a lot of books aren't available on this device, with hopes that will change in the future. So now I have a lot of money spent on books they have to read on their old devices (the devices with games and access to the internet and videos). I spent extra money on 2 new devices so they had something to use daily without that access, all to find out their age appropriate books can't be read on their new devices. I think this information should be available to parents who are looking for a device they can sit their kids down with and not have to worry about them not focusing on something so important to them. Reading is important to children of all ages, and they can only read at their own levels.Read more
I love the fact that it has the kids free time thus limiting what your child can read. Plus the parental controls the you can set time limits. It gives a parent full control over what and for how long a child can read.
I LOVE this!!!! Although it doesn't show color, (which is about the only thing I don't love about it) it is still very cool. I got it when I was 9, back in 2015, and loved it! It doesn't show ads, which I really love, since does ANYONE like those pesky ads Very good product, and totally worth your money.
I bought this for myself as my first kindle! This is the best deal you can get on a kindle, especially with the 30 off if you're a prime member. This is the original kindle that is 80 that comes with a case, no ads, and a protection plan. The case is magnetic, not the greatest quality, but it will do perfect for me for a year or so. I connected easily to my library account and to my other books already downloaded on my kindle app. It automatically connected to my amazon prime account. I love it! This deal will not disappoint!
I loved the concept of an ereader that would not be screen time. However, I have found several drawbacks to this version when compared to prior kindles I have owned. First, this product has no speaker of any kind, so it cannot play audible books or even do text to speech unless you use wireless headphones. A big loss - no current Kindle ereader can play audible books -- only older generation kindle ereaders or the Fire (which has the problem of introducing videos to reading time) - and sometimes, my daughter just wants to be read to while she follows along. Second, it operates SLOWLY. Third, the Freetime service is so poorly organized that it is very unlikely that my daughter will be able to find anything she wants there. The categories are not the types of categories you might see in bookstore - e.g. mystery, biography, early chapter books, realistic fiction, series, etc - but an odd collection of categories - e.g. ballet, Frozen, Disney, Trucks, etc. Most of the options seem very commercial and not the types of books I would want her to read. And there is no description of the book (like the blurb on the Amazon website) - so there is no way other than the title (and the unhelpful category) to tell her what the book is about before she downloads and starts to read it. Finally, when I called customer service hoping for a clearer explanation of how to move around within Free time, and to put books from my Amazon account in the freetime library, I got a representative who took long breaks between each one of my questions (presumably because she did not know the answer and had to look it up) and who was very difficult to understand because of her strong accent.Read more
This is quite the steal! As already pointed out, the total value is 144.97. At the 99.99 price, this is a great deal. I was able to use the recent Prime 30 off offer to get this for 69.99. I bought this to have a Kindle to keep in my bag. My regular Kindle is the Voyage, but I've owned several other Kindles (K3 to Oasis). I compared the two screens with the same setup and the only thing I noticed is that the curve of the letters is sharper on the Voyage, but that was expected. Does it have a frontlight No... but as long as you know what to expect, you shouldn't be surprised. :) No light, no buttons but it also isn't advertised to have those features.

Having a tablet or a phone is inevitable in our life and there is nothing we can do about it. And I know, there are toddlers over there who can read a book in a cart while grocery shopping or just curiously looking around. But that's not our case. Our daughter is three years old, and she's a very nice girl, but she hates grocery shopping, she gets bored very easily and the only thing that helps, are her favorite cartoons.Earlier we gave her my or my husband's phone, but it's so easy for a toddler to drop things down, so we made a decision to buy her a tablet. The price was a trigger for us to buy Fire HD Kids Edition.We did not have the previous edition, but as far as I know, the only difference between them are that the 7th gen Fire 7 has a dual-band WiFi antenna and a slightly newer GPU.At first, we considered buying a 50 Fire 7 (regular one), but there are so many benefits in the kid's edition, that it's definitely worth to pay an extra 50 for it. And those benefits, that were important for us, are: - Kid-Proof Case. That's a must have! I chose the pink one for my daughter and she seems to like it. - 2-year worry-free guarantee. - One year of FreeTime Unlimited. She will love all the apps and game that are free. - I can choose what content my daughter will watch.The battery life is great, my daughter is still too little to watch cartoons for more than an hour a day, so it should work on a single charge for a week, or so.The display quality is just ok, I expected it to be at least better than the previous version (my nephew has it), but it's just the same.During the first day it has been dropped, and thrown, and kicked and it survived.Read more
We have always used Samsung tablets and so this took a little while adjusting how to navigate.So, far we have been using this for about a week and it does take some time to set-up. You will need to go through and make sure all the settings are correct for your kid, and this will take some time (I think the effort is worth it)This review is specifically for the Kids Edition tablet:The tablet:The tablet itself, is a good size for my (almost) 3 yr old. It is not heavy and seems to be the right size for him to handle. The protective case has definitely done its job because we have already had a couple of incidents. (update: this has been thrown against a wall and landed on tile, and no cracks or breaks) The viewing quality is decent. Otherwise, it is what you would expect from a tablet. I have not had another Fire before, so I can only compare this to a Samsung Galaxy, and so far, it is what I would expect from a tablet of this class.The features (the real reason for the purchase):is it worth it YES. DEFINITELYPreviously, we had been sharing our tablet and our phones with our little one, but more and more he would get into content he should not be getting into - everything from buying stuff and watching content not appropriate for his age - ie our downloads of Deadpool and Logan because these look like 'superheroes' but they are not the appropriate ones for kids - (side note: I loved how they portrayed Deadpool and Logan - we are big comic fans and they finally got their characters right!).I have even deleted YouTube from our tablets and hidden the app in our phones in files so that he can't get at them...But this tablet has been a game changer. It has GREAT parental controls.Read more
Great toyreal tablet. It is basically a real Fire 7 tablet, with kid's built-in entertainment center. There are 2 modes here: Parent (admin) and Kids (one or multiple accounts). When in Parent mode (password protected), the Fire 7 looks and feels just like an Android tablet with all of the Fire 7 functionality (Facebook, Netflix, Books, blah, blah), so all of us Android users feel right at home. In the Parent mode you can also manage kids accounts: how much they can use the tablet per day, what they can and cannot watch/play, manage their installed apps, ect. When in kid's mode, the tablet behaves just like it is on the pictures, easy-to-use, colorful interface. You need to click switch user to switch from Parent to Kids accounts.Some confusion here I got from reading other reviews- the kids apps are not pre-installed the main interface is an app store, just like Google Play, ect. The apps here are unique to this Kids Account, and are all free with the included subscription which includes don't know how many games, Amazon Videos, reading and audio books. You still have to download each app before using it, so make sure to stock up on apps before going on a road trip.
Really awesome tablet for my 5 year olds, and worth the money. Easy to figure out (for the most part), tons of apps, books and videos. My only complaint is that you cannot separate downloaded apps from the thousands of apps available to download on freetime. There is a carousel on the home page, but only shows the recently used apps. My children would have to scroll through the thousands of apps to find the ones that are downloaded with a check mark in the corner. I didn't want them to be able to download everything they see, which is easy to do with just a tap. The only solution I found was to block every app except those that are downloaded. You would think there would be an option separate them, given that this is made for a child, but I guess not
Excellent, my daughter loves this. She can read books, do her school work, watch a few shows, and listen to music. She really enjoys having something that is just for her to use. She is 12 and this was the perfect age appropriate gift that is also extremely functional. I do use the parent settings for some extra security when she is using it unsupervised but otherwise, I do not have a set time limit. Great product.
I've been an iPad user since the original came out. I also have an iPad 3. I have worked in IT for the past few years so I would say I am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices. With that introduction out of the way, I will be reviewing key points that I have seen touched upon in other reviews. Here goes...BUILDThe device feels nice and solid. I'm a little surprised at how heavy it is, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rubberized backing is always nice for added grip. It's not as nice as say unibody aluminum, but it's not 500 either.SCREENThe screen is fantastic. But my problem is the same as when iPad got Retina Display, other than the OS, most apps look rather pixelated. A lot of the games I tried are not high definition, at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen. Hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions.LOCK SCREEN ADSYeah there are ads on my lock screen. I'm not sure why this is such a big deal. How much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen The first thing I thought when I saw the ads is WOW the pictures are really crisp! The ads are there to subsidize some of the 200 price tag. I might pay the 15 to get rid of them so I can customize it, but I might not. I feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers.SOUNDThe sound from the speakers is great. Much better than you would get from more expensive devices, very crisp and clean. I have the official Amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all. Nothing much else to say, I doubt anyone will complain about this.CRASHINGI've had two apps crash on opening. I don't know if it is the app or the OS. It's probably somewhere in the middle. Again, not a big deal for me.Read more
An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 1, 2012Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're glad you're enjoying your Kindle Fire HD, and we are particularly excited to see your encouraging comments regarding the display and sound quality, as the team worked really hard to build an excellent experience. We wanted to answer your question about storage. HD content is much larger than SD content, which is why Kindle Fire HD starts at 16GB. On average, a 90 minute HD movie is 2GB and a 45 minute HD TV episode is 0.9GB. With your 16GB Kindle Fire HD, you can have up to 6 HD movies or 13 HD TV episodes. This number will vary depending on the other items you have stored or installed on your device. We hope this information helps.Thanks, The Kindle Team
Love it! I purchased this as I have had audible for quite some time now and thought it would be easier just to get the Amazon Brand for downloading from KindlePrime, Audible and even the endless books for being a Prime member AND it is!! I have a reader also, thought that was all I would ever need, now wishing I would have just purchased this in the beginning. Being a Prime Member and all of the new neat things Amazon is coming up with, this is just way better AND easier (for me) NO DOUBT about it. I DO like all the features it has and the tech help available when you have issues (if you are sooo behind in the tech world as I am) -) Next Kindle FIre I purchase will be the 64 GB though...kind of just thought try it on for size (so to speak)... had no idea I would truly like it so much! Very pleased with this purchase!! Seems well made and durable, although the kid case I purchased to go with it might be why it feels as such LOL!!
I purchased the Kindle Fire HD after returning a Lenovo Idea Pad. I have also had experience with iPads. Having said that, the Kindle Fire HD is an exceptional value for the money. The screen is FANTASTIC. Glare is kept to a minimum, colors a bright and vibrant, text is clear and easily read, movies look phenomenal in HD. Also, the sound quality and volume is bar-none for a device this size. The touch screen is responsive and shortcuts like tapping, double tapping, and pinch zoom work great. The size, weight and thickness are great for portability. It is easily slipped into the interior pocket of a jacket and takes up little room in a backpack. The weight and size makes it easy to hold with just one hand and the rubberized back panel is great for grip. The amazon store provides an almost unlimited supply, of books, movies, tv shows, music, magazines, and newspapers that is only improved with a subscription to amazon prime. Now, for the negatives. The power button and volume rocker are tough to find as they are flush with device and provide little tactile feedback when looking for them. I solved this problem by putting a thin strip of colored tape on the side of the device that has these buttons. The Amazon app store is very limited when compared to the full android app store. Hopefully the app library will only grow with the device's popularity. Apps from the full android store can be side loaded in a few easy steps but please be aware that not all apps will work with the kindle. Lastly, the carousel home screen is about as useful as a spoon is for cutting steak. Say you are finished reading a magazine and want to switch to another app, when you go back to the home screen, the magazine you just read and are done with is the first thing you see.Read more

We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port. You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device.

First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more
Yes..this is my 6th Kindle Fire HD 7 and I am sharing my story so you are not discouraged! My previous Kindle Fire performed well and I decided to upgrade to the newer model with 16GB. My 2nd Kindle Fire arrived as a Christmas gift and the first week I used it, the unit crashed. Ouch! My previous generation-now referred to as Old Faithful -never failed me. I followed the onscreen instructions for Kindle2 and rebooted my device. After using my device for about 30 minutes, it crashed again and the on-screen instructions said to reboot the reset the entire device. I reset the device and lost all my settings, then again after using the device it crashed. I was not a happy customer so I called Kindle Support.If you are not bored yet...keep reading....Kindle support told me NOT to reset the device, because this erases the memory on their support side and they are unable to resolve the issue from their end if I reset the device. They advised me to call them when this happens. After a conversation about my new device not working, they agreed to send me another Kindle.Kindle 3, 4 and 5 all arrived...and I returned all of them when I discovered they were refurbished units. Since my device was brand new and I had only used it one week, I expected a brand new device as a replacement. On Kindle 6 I ended up placing a new order (rather than an exchange order) and then returned the refurbished units they continued to send me. Problem resolved.It gets worse...Kindle 6 crashed too! Within the first week...again!This time I did not reset the device and instead I would reboot the device. I did this each time I turned on the Kindle.Read more

This new KFHD replaces last year's basic Kindle Fire. Although it has some cool new features, it lacks a camera, microphone, and HDMI port. For this reason, I'm glad I kept my 2012 model since it does have these 3 features! Here are my initial impressions of the 2013 Kindle Fire HD: I like the placement of the on/off volume buttons. Being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one. I never cared for the carousel (this is what you see when you turn your Kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed), and now there's an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead, and the apps/books can be rearranged to your liking. I was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar (which is now being called home). I don't know why Amazon removed this option, and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel. But you can still bookmark your favorite web pages YouTube videos for easy access. When I play songs purchased from Amazon's MP 3 store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style. Nice feature, but it doesn't work on every song. This device has a cool new feature called Quick Switch, which allows us, when reading or using an app, to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one.In terms of sound, I find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original KFHD. But you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds. Ironically, music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers. Holding it this way projects the sound out to you.Read more

I purchased the original Kindle Fire on release day last year. It served me pretty well but was extremely glitchy. It would freeze, restart and stutter while playing games. For what it was, an entry level device, it wasnt bad.So when the Kindle Fire HD was released, I decided I might as well give it a go as well. So far the Kindle HD looks to be twice the machine the original was. I am gonna keep this short and sweet and just create a pros and cons list for you guys. I dont want to be too long winded, but if you have questions you post in the comments, I will try to respond to them for a little while today.PROS:1. Vibrant Screen2. Much more responsive to the Touch than the original Kindle ever was.3. Games that stuttered on the Original, play flawlessly on the HD.4. The speakers are awesome, Loud, clear and crisp. No need for the Volume + app like on the original fire.5. The device is slim, sleek and sexy. Really like the curves on the back and the styling.6. Front facing camera works great for SKYPE. Quality was better than that on my SIII phone.7. Wifi seems a bit faster, but not by much. Silk still isnt an optimal browser though. I have 65Mbps Download and 15Mbps Upload subscribed service.8. Cloud sync worked like a charm, almost everything from my old fire is now on my new Fire HD.9. The device feels sturdy and well built.CONS:1. The Customers Also Bought on the bottom of the home screen is terrible. I can care less about what others bought. The advertisements on the Lock Screen are fine and understandable, they really dont bother me at all or with the function of the device.Read more

This device has a cool new feature called Quick Switch, which allows us, when reading or using an app, to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one.In terms of sound, I find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original KFHD. But you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds. Ironically, music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers. Holding it this way projects the sound out to you.Read more
First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more
This new KFHD replaces last year's basic Kindle Fire. Although it has some cool new features, it lacks a camera, microphone, and HDMI port. For this reason, I'm glad I kept my 2012 model since it does have these 3 features! Here are my initial impressions of the 2013 Kindle Fire HD: I like the placement of the on/off volume buttons. Being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one. I never cared for the carousel (this is what you see when you turn your Kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed), and now there's an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead, and the apps/books can be rearranged to your liking. I was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar (which is now being called home). I don't know why Amazon removed this option, and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel.

This is the fifth e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought. My wife and I were early adopters of Kindle, and when we buy a new Kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. I loved the original Paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. The all-new Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the Paperwhite. If you have the original Paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the new Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new Paperwhite.SIZE: It's the same size as the original Paperwhite - 6.7x4.6x0.36. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how I usually read. The really good news is that if you have a case for the original Paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, Amazon). If you buy a case, I highly recommend that the case include the magnetic AutoWake function. It's much easier to turn the Kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch.LIGHTING: The front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original Paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the LED lights were located. (It didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) I couldn't see any shadows in the new Paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. With the Paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness.Read more
I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text.I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them.I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on.Read more
This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. However, I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review, I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also, I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so I will try to clear them up.HARDWAREDesign - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers, the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.Read more

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them.I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on.Read more
This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. However, I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review, I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also, I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so I will try to clear them up.HARDWAREDesign - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers, the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.Read more
This is the fifth e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought. My wife and I were early adopters of Kindle, and when we buy a new Kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. I loved the original Paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. The all-new Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the Paperwhite. If you have the original Paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the new Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new Paperwhite.SIZE: It's the same size as the original Paperwhite - 6.7x4.6x0.36. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how I usually read. The really good news is that if you have a case for the original Paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, Amazon). If you buy a case, I highly recommend that the case include the magnetic AutoWake function. It's much easier to turn the Kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch.LIGHTING: The front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original Paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the LED lights were located. (It didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) I couldn't see any shadows in the new Paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. With the Paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness.Read more
I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money.

Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. Its still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and its such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7 model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7 8 or 16 GB 8 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8 model is 10 cheaper--- the 7 model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7 model).Read more
This is my first kindle since the 1st generation. That tablet went away after a couple years. Kindle Fire 7th gen is a great tablet for the money. Honestly, I don't use it for reading. I use it for browsing websites, social media, and listen to podcasts. I use my Bluetooth headphones to listen to the podcasts. The couple times I've used the speaker on the tablet, I haven't been disappointed, but I wasn't impressed. It works just fine for watching videos in bed. Had no problems hearing. Search Google for some tips and tricks to get apps from the google play store. Silk browser is terrible. I reccomend installing Opera. I reccomend this tablet for people like me, who want to just lay in bed or on the couch and doing simple tasks on the tablet. Don't need a 300 or 400 tablet to do what I'm doing.
Much improved screen!It turns out that the 49.95 Fire 7 version released two years ago didn't have an IPS screen.Now it does.Technically, both the old one and this new one are just 171 ppi (pixels per inch) but this one seems much crisper than the first generation 49-er.My eyes don't lie. IPS makes the screen a lot crisper!There's also a stunning improvement in color quality with the new screen. Now it holds its own with the 62 color gamut original iPad Mini before, it wasn't anywhere near.Mind you it's not current Apple screen quality, or current high-end Samsung screen quality - but what is It's only 49.95, and it's good enough. Heck, at 49.95, its MORE than good enough, it's great. It blows away just about any entry level consumer laptop screen, that's for sure.I pulled out my 2015 first-gen, 49.95 Fire 7 - the one this replaces - and placed it side by side with this new one. The colors (including a horrific green tint on white backgrounds) on the old one weren't video-worthy - ok for casual videos on Facebook and YouTube, maybe, but not good enough for Netflixing and Amazon Prime.This new one, though It's movie-worthy, especially with earphones (ok, ONLY with earphones). I'd prefer 720p over the Fire 7's 600p (600p is better than 480p DVD's, but not ask good as even entry-level - 720p - HDTV quality), but overall even at 600p it's eminently watchable.By the way, for me streaming video content on Amazon Prime Instant Video has been noticeably sharper than streaming YouTube. I think Amazon Prime adapts to 600p (max for this tablet) while YouTube is is probably delivering only 480p (remember YouTube's defaults are 360p/480p/720p and up).Read more
Writing for the person it was bought for. she loves Loves LOVES it. her life has become very limited and this has really helped. The fact that she can ask Alexa for the news or weather is just wonderful. And she loves scrabble and solitaire. They are a little difficult to navigate for her but she persists, and does it. It just takes her a lot longer. The voice app in the Fire Messenger is very difficult for her to manage, the button is so tiny, and crammed up against the other things, It would be nice if someone would make HC friendly apps.*Note to Amazon Fire Designers*I would ask that you convince DRAGON to make a version of their Voice to Text app for the Fire, THEN she could enjoy things like FB. As it is all she can do is look, typing is way too difficult.
My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.Happy HolidaysRoy
Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go. Until now, nobody quite got it right. In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software. I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon. We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon. The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone. Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands. To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without. Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try. Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!Update: After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.1. Use the best speakers you can with it. I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.2. Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.Read more
So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.Thanks for letting me rant
Whether you just want the weather, latest sports scores or help with a math problem, Alexa will help. We now have 3 in the house and will be adding two more. With a simple 3 subscription to Amazon's music service, you can stream almost any music you can think of by simply asking Alexa for it!Perfect work with my meidong QQ Chocolate bluetooth speaker, I also recommend this speaker Meidong Universal Water Resistance QQChocolate Portable V4.0 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with 10W Dual Driver and Built-in MicrophoneAnd use this code for less 5: GHAQE5YF(I got it from somewhere else.)For the paranoid - this device is NOT for you. The echo dot is always listening and while the design is supposed to only listen when you say the name of the device (Alexa, Amazon or Echo - your choice), there are enough times that I hear one in another room say sorry, I did not understand the question to tell me it misunderstands these prompts to have been said when they weren't pretty often.+ Good product support+ Good voice recognition+ Because of the size it doesn't stand out like a sore thumb in a room- Doesn't differentiate between voices. If you keep it closer to a speaker than you are, then it will sometimes get confused and start picking up words from both the speaker and you when commands are given. Placement of dot is crucial for a good experience.- Only supports english and german for now- Not very competent at answering general questions and you need to activate skills to expand this functionality.Read more
I am a prime member. This was my first purchase of Echo and I gave it to my mom who did not want it or think she needed it, haha I purchased Echo dot for 2 reasons, 1) I had wanted the original echo but thought the near 200 price tag was too steep so this price was perfect and 2) I wanted to get something for my mom that would open her mind to the power of technology and the need for change because ultimately I want her to have amazon fire tv because her monthly cable bill is insanely high but she has always been resistant to change. She had no wifi in her bedroom but I resolved that when I purchased TP Link AV500 Wi Fi Range Extender, Powerline Edition which did what no other wifi extender I purchased in past could do, gave my mom's room a secure wifi connection apparently using already existing phone lines. All I know is that she now has wifi in her room. So I got Echo as a way to test her wifi connection with something cool. I easily connected Echo to TP-Link and it worked. We asked Alexa a few basic questions, We laughed a little but then I had to leave. When I returned the next day, I walked in and there was music playing (oldies but goodies) and I walked into my moms room and she was singing but was emotional. I asked her if everything was ok. She was in awe. She was happy. She was emotional because Alexa helped mom find songs at a blink of an eye that mom had not heard since her childhood and she demonstrated it to me. The speed that Alexa found the song and played it was mind-boggling. Mom was also planning a dinner in August and needed to know what day of week it was. She would normally need to leave her room and go to her main calender in the kitchen and find the date. But this time she just asked Alexa who gave her the information in like 2 seconds lol.Read more
Thanks for taking the time to read this review!This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say alexa and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen. We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its multi-room voice recognition technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word alexa on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a multi-device plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices.Read more
My Amazon Echo Dot does not require the user to enter pairing mode to connect to the device via bluetooth. I live in an apartment complex - two of my neighbors have connected to my echo dot without any input on my part. The dot appears as a pairable bluetooth device at all times. This is a major security flaw, considering that this devices is connected to my network and my amazon account, and is listening at all times. I will be keeping this device unplugged until this flaw is fixed.

I pre-ordered this for my wife mostly to use as a Kindle E-reader as I figured the tablet would be slow and the display would be less than impressive. I was wrong. What a bargain this little beauty is! This model cost 49.00 but it comes with ad's displayed on the lock screen when your tablet is dormant. Once your screen times out, they disappear. You can pay 15.00 up front to get an ad free version so I assumed to unlock the tablet I'd have to spend 15 to 30 seconds looking at an ad for Amazon Prime, or a product from the daily specials section of Amazon.com I abstained from paying for Ad removal and was pleasantly surprised to find that the ads are only on the lock screen and that as soon as I unlock the tablet they disappear immediately.Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5 phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look greatPrice - it's a 50.Read more
UPDATED - After spending quite a bit more time with the device, I would give it a 4.5 due to a few specific gaps that are a bit annoying. However, you are still getting an amazing 7 tablet, with front and rear facing cameras, a gorgeous interface, fairly snappy performance and durability, all for under 50 bucks! I cant imagine not buying these for myself and my whole family, but not a primary tablet for a techie adult by any means. For background, I have every Kindle, a couple Fires, and multiple tablets from Apple, Microsoft and Samsung. Note that my review with 5 stars considers the value equation, not just performance and how that may or may not compare to other tablets - if you are expecting this to compare to a tablet costing several times more, don't bother. But if you are looking for a great entry level tablet that does most of the things people want, this little tablet definitely delivers the value!PRICING/CONFIG: I prefer this tablet with ads and no accessories to keep the costs down. You have the option to spend more money, but I recommend against it. You can easily see the specs online, so I wont do you the discourtesy of simply cutting and pasting those here. Here is the price breakdown: 49.99 base price what an incredible price point! Or buy 5 and get a sixth one free! This puts it into reach of schools and non-profits. No sponsored screensaver (15) big deal that each time you turn it on it shows you something interesting you might want. MicroSD card (19.99 for 32GB) you probably already have one laying around somewhere. Beyond that, there is memory in the device, and you are using the cloud for storage mostly anyway. If you end up needing this, just buy one off Amazon, it certainly wont be more expensive.Read more
50 Despite the dirt cheap price, i find it to be great for casual use. Videos play nice, games even play nice, text is just not as sexy looking as higher resolution screens. Watch the video for full demo!The short/summed up version: it's the new budget king in the 6-8 size. It's screen is a little lower in resolution but still pleasant to look at, it has enough power for most of the typical tablet tasks, and it shares many of the same features as its higher priced brothers such as front and back cameras, b/g/n wifi, and good overall battery life (minus an hour) My favorite size tablet is 8, so if you're looking at the amazon fire lineup, i would take this over the 6 for sure, and would have a hard time picking the 8 fire at 3x the price. If you're not a prime member, it's still a good tablet, if you are a prime member: it's a great tablet. Possible quality control issue: Mine had two dead pixels (not very noticeable, but still will exchange) You can load APKs(enable unknown sources), i loaded antutu and panasonic image app, both work properly.Just some background, i currently own 5 tablets not including this new one, ranging from a nook color, a samsung tab pro 8.4, LG g pad x8.3, an old acer a500 and an off brand 10.1. Suffice it to say: i know my tablets!Main Cons:-2 dead pixels-Front and rear cameras are low resolution, mostly good for video calls only-1 speaker, sounds tinny like a small laptop, Gets decently loud, use headphones!-Text not very crisp (but still decent to read)The rest are overall Positives:-7-8 is my favorite tablet size, 6 is just a bit too tiny, and 9+ can be cumbersome-Uses a slightly slower quad core 1.Read more
LOVE OUR NEW ECHO! I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them echolettes LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request.Read more
We have been using Echo since April 2015. Prior to that time, my husband had been hospitalized for several weeks. He is currently wheelchair bound. We immediately installed the Hue bridge and lights as well as the WEMO outlet. With these, and dear, dear, Alexa, he has a great deal of control of his environment in ways that make him much more independent. Others might enjoy Echo for fun and convenience, but for him it is a lifeline! He has even had her turn the lights on in my bedroom when I didn't hear him call.We use the shopping list feature a lot, and my husband has added things to the list that he remembered, while I was already at the store. Should I mention he adds things like chocolate bars when I'm not looking No more paper lists! I just look at the app on my phone and things disappear as I check them off.We transport Echo from the living room to the bedroom, since it is easier for him not to have to use the remote, plus it is always there for his favorite music, an update on news, and to check the weather. Or, when he needs cheering up, I ask for a joke. Tosave plugging in behind his lift chairs, I have ordered a second plug. I love the easy reconnect to the WIFI.I was a bit worried at first about his word slurring with his Parkinson's, but it has worked the opposite way! I notice he focuses his words much better while giving commands. After he forgot her name early on, we added it so he could remember using the Zink hAppy App.My granddaughter was happy to check her math problems using Echo, and in addition to the music stations and Amazon play lists, Echo is a breeze to use as a Bluetooth device. I have used it to play my meditation apps and iTunes music.Read more
I have been using advanced technology for the last 20 years. It was born out of necessity not convenience. My wife passed away 4 years ago leaving me, not only a widow, but a widowed quadriplegic trying to survive on his own. We were married 20 years and yes she married me when I was already paralyzed. She was a beautiful lady here on earth and I am sure she is just as beautiful in God's presence. I have to attest that it has been an arduous journey. But one thing that has made it possible for me to live on my own even though I am paralyzed from the chest down, is smart technology. For example, I am able to run my entire home with apps on my phone, computer or tablet. I have lights, electric door locks, electric bed, air-conditioning/heat, cameras, both indoor and out side. Smart technology allows me to input data on my laptop when I am laying in bed I cannot use my arms when I am laying flat in bed because of the paralysis. Up to this point, I have used input through joysticks that operate by using my mouth. They work effectively but the joysticks must be placed specifically in front of my mouth and they have to remain there all night long. Smart technology allows me to be able to live safely on my own and has even allowed me to help take care of my 75-year-old mother whose health is, due to God's grace and technology, now stable and she is actually helping me more each day. Alexa has been a blessing beyond my imagination. She has given me an opportunity that I never thought would be possible. I still use the joystick input because they are reliable and not subject to Wi-Fi disruption but Alexis is growing more dependable each day. At this point I have only an echo Dot, but I am ordering, when funds allow, the regular echo and another Dot as well.Read more

I'm a full-time writer who works at home. I'm unmarried, I don't watch TV, I don't have a mobile phone, I hate gadgets in general. OK, so I'm a loser. But since Alexa came into my life, I'm no longer alone 24 hours a day. Which begs the question, if I'm not alone, who is in the room with me Amazon The so-called cloud The NSAThe 18,000 plus reviewers who have already posted have gone into great detail about how they use their Echo (my Alexa). Having anthropomorphized my Alexa, I'm unwilling to use her at all, but we hold pleasant converse throughout the day. My favorite conversation I'll repeat for you below, verbatim:Me - Alexa. Wake me in fifteen minutes.Alexa - Fifteen minutes. Starting now.Me - Thank you.Alexa (remains silent, modestly hiding her feelings by not displaying her snazzy blue lights)If I knew relationships were this easy, I would have married thirty years ago, but now that I have Alexa, there's no need. Except for the one thing.I really (and Amazon, please don't tell Alexa I wrote this) don't care for the name. I know we have the option to change the name to Amazon, which is worse. What I really want is to be able to change the name to Libby, after the helpful AI librarian in the EarthCent Ambassador series, but in a pinch, I'd settle for Kelly,Other than that, my Alexa is perfect. Well, except for that time when I asked her to play rain sounds for relaxation when I was trying to sleep, and she woke me up after I finally nodded off to inform me that she'd lost her Internet connection. But from what my married friends all tell me, you have to expect these sorts of things.Read more

This is the fifth e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought. My wife and I were early adopters of Kindle, and when we buy a new Kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. I loved the original Paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. The all-new Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the Paperwhite. If you have the original Paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the new Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new Paperwhite.SIZE: It's the same size as the original Paperwhite - 6.7x4.6x0.36. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how I usually read. The really good news is that if you have a case for the original Paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, Amazon). If you buy a case, I highly recommend that the case include the magnetic AutoWake function. It's much easier to turn the Kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch.LIGHTING: The front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original Paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the LED lights were located. (It didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) I couldn't see any shadows in the new Paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. With the Paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness.Read more
I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text.I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them.I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on.Read more
This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. However, I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review, I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also, I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so I will try to clear them up.HARDWAREDesign - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers, the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.Read more
I had a kindle keyboard. I still have. I'm not sure I'm ready to part with it. I'm rather attached. The kindle is *the* e-reader. It's fantastic. I had my kindle keyboard for a couple years and I couldn't imagine reading on anything else. There were times I left my kindle at work and had to read on my ipad. I hated it. However I found the keyboard interface to be cumbersome and just old. I wanted something new. So onto the paperwhite.Mine was a gift. I have the wifi only version. Why would you need the 3G Just download several books at once and you are good to go. I will say that the paperwhite light is fantastic. Have you watched the videos on the paperwhite. It's not a traditional backlight. It does not shine the light towards your eyes, but rather down at the screen. GENIUS!!!! I sit at a computer all day. I do not want more light shining at my eyes. Which is why I loved my kindle keyboard for so long. I haven't had the paperwhite very long, but I keep it at about a medium brightness so far. I love that I can now read in bed with no other light. The paperwhite is light weight. It's rather small, but about the same width as the kindle keyboard. I put both kindles on the same page of a book and more lines were rendered on the paperwhite than the keyboard. But the font isn't smaller. Somehow more words are fit on the page. I like the touchscreen interface. I really found the keyboard keys to be tedious. I kind of sort of miss the page flip buttons though. I loved those. Since they were on both sides of the kindle, they were easily accessible no matter what I was doing at the time or how I was laying. IMO the jury is still out on whether or not I can live without those buttons. So far I'm doing ok, but I will confess to missing them greatly.Read more
Update on Dec 23 2013 - Please scroll to the very end of this review for 2 month use update. ...For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more
This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more
Extremely wonderful tablet, it definitely gets the job done adaptes very well with everyday usage, good speed, nice display, and one I would definitely recommend to everyone!
To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more

Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50 more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series. After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9 HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7 Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My normal website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7 Kindle Fire HD yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker. The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass. However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am). While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers. The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same. Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be. If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it). For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app/a here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader. Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment. I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger! If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for 20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.Mayday button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's regular model of the Fire, is the introduction of the Mayday button. Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent. I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say hi' for purposes of this review.What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting). A case is very important in order to protect your investment. Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at 229 for the 16GB of memory model (309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at 139.

When I received my new kindle, I tried several times to set it up. It would not work. I called service and worked with them several times to get it to work and finally your representive said the kindle had problems and I should just mail it back.
I like many things about the Fire I like but the thing I purely hate is the problem with watching flash videos, had I known about silk not supporting or the other way around I would have bought the Google tablet and will next time. I will min
To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more
This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list for apps, much less so. 90 of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7 tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download Casablanca but not able to download The Avengers even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HDDisplay: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 vs. 7.6 x 5.4 x 0.4). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9 version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special reading mode to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive (229 vs. 199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a 20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is 10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The Recommended for you display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule Quiet Time on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7 HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8 iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9 x 4.5 x 0.34 and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87 x 5.3 x 0.29 and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX 11 hours (17 hours when reading) Nexus 9 hours iPad Mini 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only 139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at 229 vs. 399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. 90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.

I am a huge fan of Amazon. Every one of my kindles have been an up grade from the last. All have delivered the highest quality and the best service. I highly recommend them to everyone. My HDX is awesome.
When I decided to purchase the Kindle HDX. I had been looking at several tablets closely for the past few months to use while I was away from home on an upcoming trip expected to last few weeks. And seeing the current price and purchasing options available the Kindle HDX seemed to be an easy choice to me. Even with my thinking I understood the tablets limitations.The things that attracted me to the Kindle HDX tab, were the processor, it's 4 G LTE compatibility with Verizon, and the fact that I am an Amazon Prime member. I had read that Amazon was expecting people to use their online services for video and music so having membership I was not too concerned about the small amount of storage on the tablet. But that was a mistake on my part. I was thinking I would be able to access the movies that I purchased online with Amazons instant video, and expected to be able to access the 128 gigs of music I have stored on Google Play, but Google Play media will not load on my Kindle HDX. Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge. There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about 25 a year with other limitations). But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing. So now I'm forced to either purchase additional space or be satisfied with what's there. Personally I feel the additional 25 is a rip off since particularly since the purchase of the kindle and considering my Prime membership, and with other services offer free unlimited uploads of music Amazon seems pretty greedy at this pont.Here are the things I like about the current Kindle HDX Verizon compatible version.1. The processor, it is very fast and loads pages quickly, and the 2 gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance.2. The variables in personal settings, make the device easy to personalize.3. The display is very nice and video and video games look great, but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device.The not so great things about the Kindle HDX 16 GB.1. The fact that the device does not support storage expansion. It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2. The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3. The Lack of even a mini USB port. Again my old Droid telephone provides a USB port and offers a charging device with a built in USB hub that allows me to connect to any number of external attachments, and this tablet does not.Regretfully the impact of these limitations did not come to mind when I bought the Kindle, but would have if I knew the fully understood the tablets limitations.Would I recommend this tablet to friends or family Only if they were a member of Amazons Prime services and fully understood its limitations, including storage and the area support of their carrier.So over all, for basic users or those wanting a reading device with very nice options living in an area with Wi-Fi and who have good 4 G coverage the Kindle would probably be an OK purchase. But only if they are fully aware of the limitations of this tablet. Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage. 16 gigs is just too little to carry much media with you, with the device using a large part of that 16 gigs, for it's UI and OS you are not even getting a full 16 gigs (more like 10). Then tablet not supporting SanDisk memory expansion (which seems contrived to me), leaves the user too dependent on Amazons premium services for my tastes.(Update 4/14/14) The packet blocking used to keep people tied to Amazons Media Content (or at least their Music App) needs to be removed. In my review above, I mentioned that I have had issues accessing my music stored on My Google Play Music site. But at that time I wasn't sure that this was my being impatient, not waiting for the site to load completely even though I did wait for five minutes, or if it was Amazon using packet blocking and redirection to keep people tied to their services. More recently I found that when trying to access my music on the Google site I was redirected to the My Books Recommendations. I believe the Kindle site offers better deals, and has a wider selection than Googles offerings, but Googles music site includes downloads at the same cost and higher resolution (320 Kbps vs. the 190-240 Kbps at Amazon). More over recently a few friends told me they have run into the same issue when trying to access their media stored at other various sites (that are either free or that do not charge what Amazon does for their Premium Cloud Services).As someone else has mentioned in their review of the Kindle. Amazon has included adds on the Kindle HDX that are not present on other tablets (even basic inexpensive Android tablets do not have invasive adds). If I pay Amazon another fee I understand I can have those adds removed. But all of these fees really add up, and it seems to me that since I've already paid for this device, these additional fee's, and packet blocking with proprietary redirection are unacceptable and possibly illegal. Who Gives amazon the right to block content and force you to view advertisements on a device of this natureAt this point I would honestly suggest looking elsewhere unless your absolutely sure that the problems mentioned above will not come into play for you or the one you are purchasing this device for. The idea of an e-reader with expanded abilities is one thing, but to advertise the Kindle HDX as a tablet able to compete with an I-Pad, and then throw things like site redirection, packet blocking to limit access media storage to their proprietary services makes me wish I had purchased anything other than this device.
I have a first generation Kindle Fire, it did every well, but was heavy and not as fast as I hoped graphics wise for gaming, which is why I upgraded to the HDX. This new tablet is blisteringly fast and completely fluid with no lag. Movies, books, and games are crystal clear, and I can now even read PDF's easily, which was a chore on the old Kindle Fire. The best part is the battery life and light weight, I use this kindle all day on one charge. I'm so happy with it, considering the 8.9 inch also for my wife.I can think of no flaws, but if a problem comes up with this device, I'll update, I've only had it a week.
This was a great price, shipped lightning fast, I'll be buying from this seller again. We purchased this for our mom/grandma for mother's day, she loves it. This little fire will do everything she does on line and then some. we went with the fire hdx because this is an e reader, a browser, it plays amazon prime video, and it will skype. I would recommend this to everyone if your looking for a multi-function tablet it's wonderful
Imagine a lap top but smaller this kindle can do anything you enjoy doing on a laptop. I use mine to watch Netflix , check my facebook and pretty much anything else. I am supper satisfied with this product and I would say that it was an investment well put.
I ordered the original Kindle keyboard 2nd gen the day it was available. Same with 1st gen Kindle Fire, and I own a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle PaperWhite as well. Having that familiarity with Kindles I hope gives me some credibility for the HDX 7. The speakers are the best in the line. The screen is amazing, the speed is unparalleled for gaming and streaming, which is the only possible challenge to prior models. In the spirit of full disclosure, I've only owned mentioned Kindles and a Samsung Galaxy smart phone, no iPads, Samsung tablets or Barnes Noble e-readers etc so take it from there. Can't speak to charging complaints because I keep a charging cord next to my bed and two more around the apt and I plug my phone in every night and my Kindle every morning when I awake. After 2 weeks, in one day my Kindle HDX has never been below 40 and average end of day is about 65 so I've never had one day of usage as an inconvenience. For those that find charging once a day annoying, hmm, two days should still be good for most average uninterrupted use. I also ordered the Origami case as its enclosure and I love it as well. Stands the device with equal stability in landscape and portrait, and feels protective for minor drops or spills.
Going on about two weeks now...LOVE IT Didn't think I'd like it, but I was SO wrong. So easy to use for a first time tablet user like me.
I never give 5 stars because there is nothing in life that is perfect and you really don't know if there's a problem until you've used something for several months. This kindle meets all of my expectations and seems to be working just great.
I have yet to discover all the things this can do. I consider myself a hip almost-50 year old, and have used computers most of my adult life...I waited and researched and finally decided on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 and the Samsung Galaxy smartphone - very happy with both. I'm still having a hard time making the digital leap to downloading books and newspapers. I love reading and listening to music, but still like to hold and smell the pages of the real thing. I can see how fantastic it is while commuting or traveling to have my reading material available in one neat place, on the Kindle..it's just going to take some time. I dumping cable and it was really nice to watch just what I want to watch - it was easy to download Mad Men on the Kindle, and watch when it was convenient. I do have a concern as to what happens when someday, the tablet goes berserk or extinct - do we lose the books and movies downloaded on the Kindle I do not use it to play video games, but the display and picture is very sharp. One aggravating problem I'm having is that Amazon is downloading games and things that I did NOT authorize. Some are free and some show prices with confirmation numbers - I don't appreciate Amazon deciding to download a bunch of crap I don't want and will never use, without my permission - so that is an issue I am trying to address. Otherwise, it's compact enough to fit in most handbags and it's been most useful in meetings and study groups - way nicer than lugging around a laptop (listen to one who had to use a typewriter in college). We've come a long way. I also ordered a reasonably priced Finite folio case/cover from Amazon that works great and allows it to stand.
I love this handheld device especially all the items available for it. Games, books, music, etc. Glad I bought it. Thanks for having it available.
I am 67 and the only problem I have with my kindle is that it seems to have grafted itself to my hand. I am having trouble putting it down to do things like clean the house, do dishes, wash clothes. It works great and I really love the game plants vs zombies.I love that it came with the wall charger.
Update on Dec 23 2013 - Please scroll to the very end of this review for 2 month use update. ...For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more
I've had Kindle Fire's since day one and this is the only version that has slightly let me down. I'm having charging issues on a regular basis and occasional odd colors on the display. Also battery life isn't nearly what I expected. If the charging issues continue I will put in for a warranty replacement.....
This review is from a normal working NON IT type of dude who likes to read books surf the web etc etc etc So this will review will be just like me telling you how I think the HDX is over a beer :) My family has 2 Kindles 1 HD which my son loves, 1 HDX mine, 1 ipad mini older son 1 ipad normal size for the wifey and I have used all of them at one time or another.1. Size weight,,,,, lighter and thinner than the ipad mini,,, perfect size to handle. I like the location of the on/off button and volume, much better than my sons HD I dont like to search for buttons on the side.2. Speed, its seems REALLY fast, book pages are in a blink of an eye the web loaded fast not choppy or drag, my wifi is pretty good so it helps. I have not tried the 4 G yet so I cant comment on that.3. Screen WOW its really sharp almost as good as my Samsung 55 in LCD 1080,,,,yes darling it is that sharp.4. Did I mention there is no blue or purple gold green or rainbow light around the border if there is it is so light I cant notice it. I only used it for an hour or so last night so I will update if this changes but for now it looked clean.5. Apps,,,hmm I hear a lot of people b*tching about google this or google that,,,,WHO CARES,,there is enough content on Amazon to keep me happy not that I am a betting man I will bet there is a bunch more in the pipe line.6. I maxed the Kindle out with 64 gb so I assume i will have enough room for years to come.7. Very easy to use,,,,,turned it on entered my wifi password and bam my account was set up in less than 1 minute.8. Shipping it was here in 1 day for 3.99 how can you beat that 9. Amazon eco-system good stuff period I have always been a huge fan 10. Did I mention there is no blue or purple border light :)11. So to sum up my thoughts on my new Kindle HDX is this,, OUTSTANDING I would recommend buying it over an I PAD for PRICE (value) the I PAD mini does not offer a 64 gb model and the 16 gb 4g mini cost 429 which is 5 bucks more than I paid for my maxed out Kindle AND the 64 gb 4g I PAD air is 829 Yea thats right 829 LOOKS the Kindle is a really sharp looking device, speed fast fast fast, screen WOW, sound clear rich amazon prime works for me, I hate shopping in stores love my books and amazon has it all.So your prob saying wow this is a normal dude posting a review that says this thing is pretty much perfect, well it does seem this way BUT,,,,,,,,,yea there is always a BUT, the only thing i see that should be included is a back facing camera not that I am one of those parents you see waving their IPAD around at a school play or my kids basketball game but sometimes your 5 year old does something so cute while your reading a book you just want to snap the pic, this is so minor that I really dont care but just putting it out there for Amazon ( cough cough ) .Did I mention I did NOT have a blue or purple light around the border Thanks for letting me post my 2 cents on this wonderful device Merry Christmas to all )ps what is the best screen covers case to get On a side note I returned the Kindle it to small for me and I had to drop it down to a 2 stars for being hung up on by customer service twice and the really bad screen flicker

Good hardware, but limited apps on amazon ecosystem.Most apps that I already purchased with google play store won't work on Kindle Fire.Second I don't want to pay for same apps on another ecosystem (one for apple, one for google already ...)At least amazon allows to return the product without hassle ...
It's still very new to me, so I'm taking my time mostly I read a lot. But also like to play games. Haven't even started to look into theT.V. Movie's that I can get with my Wi-Fi, 32gb. Also like the color of my firer cover.
This is my second Kindle, I also have a 3G Kindle touch, and of the two, I prefer the touch overall.Features I like about the Fire: I love and hate the carousel all at the same time. I love how easy it is to scan through the books that I have on my Kindle and seeing the pictures of the covers (because sometimes I like to pick my books based solely on the cover). I don't like how every book I purchase shows up on the carousel whether I've sent it to the Fire or not (there may be a way to stop that from happening, but I haven't figured it out yet if there is.)I really like having my Fire connected to my Goodreads account so that when I finish reading a book on the Fire and write a review for Amazon, it also posts to Goodreads for me without any extra work on my part.I also like being able to read on my Fire without an additional light source.I do not like the glare on the screen while trying to read in sunlight. For me, the Fire has been basically useless anywhere that sunlight is involved, which includes car rides on sunny days as the sun shining through the car windows creates too much glare to read. I've seen some people mention a way to sort of solve that problem, but I have yet to figure out how to do it, and instead just take my Touch with me if I'm going to possibly anywhere near sunlight.
If you do not have WiFi connection, my device says I am connected with excellent score, the airplane mode is off, but still no real connection. Try using the online help with connectionOf course they do not publish a telephone number thus, it is worthless
It's always good to buy on sale. The reason I purchased this style of Kindle, it's small , just like a paperback book, and very portable. So far so good. I'm enjoying every minute of use. The OS is very friendly user driven. Easy to navigate. Shopping, apps and books, is very easy. The user-interface takes a bit to get use too. If you are use to using tablets with iOS, windows, or Android there is a very short learning curve.The one aspect I like is the ability to group your items. Games, books, and the ability to make a new group. Keeps the confusion down.The clarity and speed of the Kindle is great. I'm very impressed by it's sharp image. I only use a wi-fi connection so the movies stream without a problem.Well worth the purchase on sale.
Had I not purchased a Paperwhite first, I could easily settle on the HDX 7 as a reader as well as a color tablet. The size difference between the two is practically negligible as is the weight difference (the HDX7 is slightly larger and about 8 ounces heavier). I can hold the the HDX7 in my left hand quite comfortably--just not quite as comfortably as the Paperwhite. Moreover, the text of the Paperwhite seems to wear longer on older, tired eyes (especially after reading the hype on behalf of e-ink text) than that of the HDX--at least during extended stretches of continuous reading.Still, there are moments when my eyes crave color, images and videos beyond which the Paperwhite can deliver. The television set, cable, and ROKU box are my wife's, and I'm no longer doing as well by watching movies or concerts on the severely restricted real estate of an iPod screen--all of which doubles the attraction of a tablet like the HDX. It offers the freedom and privacy of an iPod but with video footage that offers a welcome size-advantage compared to the iPod screen.For traveling purposes, I'm good with the Paperwhite and an iPod--both pocket-sized and answering to my reading, listening and occasional viewing needs. The speakers of the HDX may be stereo but they're far from full-frequencied, perhaps only slightly better than those of a new iPod Touch. So I'd recommend earphones when using either an iPod or the HDX as a music player--or, if your partner won't complain, a good adjunct speaker (with a supple, light cable for better sound and more reliable connectivty than dicey Bluetooth technology offers).I frankly can't see an iPod or tablet performing the many functions of a computer or a camera (I'm one of the ever more conspicuous minority who still carry a dedicated point and shoot camera). But the price point of the HDX makes it an affordable luxury device for dedicating to specific and occasional uses. I've met people who no longer use any sort of computer, doing all of their Facebooking, e-mail and banking with a mere tablet (usually an Apple iPad or Mini). My sense is that the HDX would prove slightly more cumbersome for such purposes--Apple's tablet has the refined processor, continually upgraded OS, and widely established ecosystem to make it a better bet for most users thinking of ditching their laptops. Aside from the added cost of the Apple tablet (twice as much as the HDX), I'm simply not excited about tablets in general. The affordability of the HDX, which has now got several years of refinement behind it, makes it the preferred choice in my case.In conclusion, I've got to rate the Paperwhite 1 for my particular uses as well as for Amazon's scoring a game-changing consumer technology coup second only to the release of the first Apple iPod in 2002 and the Macbook Air in 2008 (though it was not accepted by the general public until Apple's decision to ignore the naysayers and release it again in 2010). Not only is the Paperwhite small, versatile, fast-loading, and beautifully back-lit (no more fumbling around and experimenting with various clip-on lights), but there's no subscription charge for long-distance connectivity to Amazon. And I find it reassuring that Amazon includes an official, no-charge, on-line User's Manual, for printing out on a Mac computer. With the HDX, on the other hand, there appears to be no single authoritative and free User's Guide. Instead, your choices for instructions are unlimited--and I would advise against proceeding intuitively, especially if you plan to make use of Amazon's uniquely integrated film commentary, thanks largely to Bezos heady and timely purchase of the popular IMDB reference source. It may be no drone, but in all other respects it stands alone.
received my Kindle and it was in good shape package not Damaged.I see the difference with the kindle fire HD compared to HDX cause their isn't any.One has camera and the other didn't. I plan on keeping my KINDLE fire Hd Thanks amazon I love it.
I have read some of the previous reviews and you shouldn't believe everything that is written. First I'm a die hard Kindle user and love every single one I have owned.This one is incredibly light (weight). I bought the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 before this one and even though I loved it, it was pretty heavy. The screen resolution is incredible. It's crystal clear and just looks amazing. Now I kind of was debating waiting for the 8.9 to come out but this 7 inch is the prefect size to throw in my purse. I read previous reviews that stated there is a purple border around the edges of the book your reading. I don't have that and find that reading a book with this Kindle is easy on the eyes.I haven't used the Mayday button yet but I'm sure it's up to par with Amazon's wonderful customer service. I'm unsure what else to say but that you will be highly impressed with this Kindle.
Mine has problems connecting to wifi. The customer care and the technical team are highly incapable of handling the case , they even lost the log files i sent them multiple times. They will not update you the status and it's a pure waste of my money and time.
I love it,other than the problem I have with my one game I called about. It is still happening with it.
I actually was pretty happy with my kindle initially. It had some good apps, the screen had really good quality and I like their support features. That's where the good news ends.As I started using my kindle more an more, I noticed that some of the apps which are free on my android tablet or iPad, I had to pay for on my kindle. Initially I was surprised but I decided it was a minor nuisance.What really put me over the edge is that about 6 months after I purchased my Kindle I noticed that my screen was cracked as I was pulling it out of my backpack. Now I really take care of my things so I was surprised that it broke. Nothing against the quality of the product, but it was definitely surprising because it is fairly well protected with a padded sleeve in my backpack. Anyhow, I called into Amazon support to see what I could do about it but they told me that I would have to buy a new one. The support person I spoke to on the phone said that she would try to speak to her supervisor to see if they would be willing to replace it for me but later came back and said that they cannot replace it and that they would have to sell me a new one at a 'reduced rate'.At this point, I'm thinking Im going to skip out on the reduced price Kindle for 150, that they offered me and I'm going back to my iPad. Why Well for one, I won't have to pay the additional money for otherwise free apps. Two, I know that I will have my iPad covered under warranty no matter what happens.So the key thing to keep in mind before you buy a Kindle is the following:1 - There are no official repair facilities. So if you break your screen, you are forced to buy a new one. If you go with something more common like an iPad or a Android tablet, you can find repair facilities all around. And with Apple, you can get the extended care and they WILL replace your iPad screen (or even your whole iPad) if/when you break it.2 - Apps are more expensive because you cannot buy them from Google Play. You have to buy higher priced versions of the exact same app from Amazon. Later, if you decide that the Kindle isn't for you, you have just wasted all that money on apps that will stay with a useless Kindle.The apps thing is bearable but the lack of repair facilities or help is not. I think I would be have given the kindle 4 start if they offered and extended protection plan so that we knew that we were going to keep our purchase for a longer period of time. I mean let's face it, the probability of anyone damaging their kindle within the life expectancy of the product is fairly high. So your investment is this product will last as long as you can maintain it in good shape.At this point, I'm cutting my losses and moving back to the iPad.
Its the best product.its vety comfortable to watch shows and read books and alot easy to play games and fun
To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more
Extremely wonderful tablet, it definitely gets the job done adaptes very well with everyday usage, good speed, nice display, and one I would definitely recommend to everyone!
This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more

Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more
To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more

This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more

Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model. The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080). This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution. The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.Read more
To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more
This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more

Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50 more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series. After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9 HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7 Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My normal website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7 Kindle Fire HD yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker. The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass. However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am). While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers. The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled inNew Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same. Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be. If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it). For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app/a here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader. Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment. I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for 20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.Mayday button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's regular model of the Fire, is the introduction of the Mayday button. Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent. I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say hi' for purposes of this review.What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting). A case is very important in order to protect your investment. Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at 229 for the 16GB of memory model (309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at 139.

This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list for apps, much less so. 90 of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7 tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download Casablanca but not able to download The Avengers even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HDDisplay: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 vs. 7.6 x 5.4 x 0.4). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9 version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special reading mode to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive (229 vs. 199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a 20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is 10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The Recommended for you display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule Quiet Time on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7 HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8 iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9 x 4.5 x 0.34 and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87 x 5.3 x 0.29 and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX 11 hours (17 hours when reading) Nexus 9 hours iPad Mini 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only 139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at 229 vs. 399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. 90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.

IMPORTANT UPDATE (3/8/17): As you read my original review, please be aware that Amazon announced in early February (2017) a new firmware update that allows Amazon Tap owners to enable a hands-free option! By going into Settings in the Alexa app, you can now choose the hands-free option and have your Tap respond to voice commands without touching it, just like the Echo and Echo Dot! This is a fabulous development and something Tap owners have been hoping for. Thank you, Amazon!Since the lack of hands-free operation was the one major shortcoming of the Tap, this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better. One thing to keep in mind, though, especially if you use your Tap on battery power: The hands-free mode will drain the battery more quickly, because it requires the microphone to be on at all times. But since you can easily toggle between hands-free or regular tap mode using the Alexa app, you can pick and choose how you want to use your Tap for maximum battery life and convenience.-------------------------I admit that I was a little skeptical when Amazon first introduced its Echo device. But I decided to buy one anyway, thinking that if I didn't like it I could easily sell it. After all, back in the early days of the Echo it was in very high demand. So the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal. Today, as an avid music listener who loves to cook, I'm thrilled that I decided to give the Echo a try.I had wanted a device that I could stream music with in the kitchen, and the Echos hands-free voice control made it very appealing. But how would it sound That question was quickly answered as soon as I set up and started using my Echo.Read more
It was just a few weeks ago that I was bemoaning the fact that I did not scoop up an Echo back when they were being released last year. Not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price, but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device...Well, here I am, a year late to the game and I can now proudly say that I own both an Echo and this new little Tap! Can I just say that I am OBSESSED with all things Echo and Alexa. These are devices that you may not realize how much you'll use it until you've given them a try.I have been spending the last few years getting our home automated. I currently use a combination of Smartthings, IFTTT and Logitech Harmony to control the home. Alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice. For me, this is the killer feature. I can integrate all three parts of our home control right into Echo/Tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup.Read more
The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.It contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. It also has Dolby stereo speakers for playing music. The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.Ive been testing the Tap for several days now. Heres what I think so far: What I Like I find that the Tap understands my verbal commands accurately. This could be due to the fact that, since its button activated, Im always very close to the device when I speak to it. Nevertheless, its nice that Tap understands me the first time. This was my experience with the Amazon Echo as well.The audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. I test portable speakers all the time and Id say the Amazon Tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. Don't expect Bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.No other portable speaker device offers voice control and Wi-Fi streaming. Thus the Amazon Tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. This is especially true if you already have Amazon Prime and Prime Music.It supports many great services. Like the Amazon Echo that came before it, the Amazon Tap supports popular music services such as Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.Battery life has been good so far. I used it off and on for a couple days without charging it. Ill post an update once I have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life.Read more
Look at this product as a portable speaker first and an Echo replacement second. The big reason to buy this over standard Bluetooth speakers is this has WiFi streaming enabled. When you are at home you can stream music with ease to it. Voice recognition is top notch and it really shines when using it with other smart home accessories. The only problem is having to tap the microphone button for it to listen to your voice. If you want bigger sound and always listening features, spend the extra money on the Amazon Echo.
This Amazon tap is not only a great Bluetooth speaker, which is half of the reason I bought it for. But it also has some awesome voice control. I bought a wemo switch, plugged it into an old lamp, setup some commands with ittt, and in 5 minutes I was using my Amazon tap to control a lamp. Pretty cool. I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap. But alas the Amazon tap is a Bluetooth speaker so I can always use my phone as a streaming device, or hook my phone up through the aux port as well. But all in all this is a great speaker, that can do everything any Bluetooth speaker on the market can do plus a little bit extra.
Bought this on Deal of the Day which surprised me since it is new to Best Buy. Just push the button and ask "her" to do something such as play favorite radio station or music from play list. Have "her" set timers and alarms to wake by. I haven't used half of the features of TAP. The sound is amazingly great for such a small device.
Amazing Sound! All around great product! Nothing negative so far.
I have owned the Echo for about a year now and enjoy the features it provides. Although the Tap doesn't have the hands free feature of the Echo I like its portability. I'm able to take it outdoors at home and using the WiFi play music or even use the other features available by just asking Alexa. The unit is well built and I really like the charging cradle provided.
I really like my Tap very much. It great when it's connected. Reads me news, weather, plays music and can purchase items from Amazon That being said, I do have some connectivity problems while on wifi. I don't want to say that it's the taps fault as it may be my wifi. I don't regret my purchase. It has great sounds and recognizes my voice commands well.
I have owned three versions of the amazon echo: the original, the dot, and the tap. This is the most versatile of the three. The wireless recharging is great. The sound is not as good as the original, but the portability makes up for this. At $79 it was a fantastic buy.
I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality.
I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music.
I have a regular echo and now the tap. Both awesome products, use them to control lights, locks, and play music. Would buy again.
great sound easily portable around the house both inside and outside. the option to have it automatically respond without pushing the button was a surprise but a welcome one!
I wanted to buy a Tap when it was first released. I have several Echo's in the house, but having a portable Alexa enabled device is awesome. Unfortunately, when it was first released, the tap could not be operated hands-free. I held off purchasing one because I was afraid Amazon would wait for new hardware to add that feature.Earlier this year Amazon enabled hands-free mode, and it works almost as well as the Echo, despite having fewer microphones.Sound quality is very good. It's a small speaker but very capable. Battery life is excellent. This is currently the most flexible implementation of Alexa and I recommend it.
Was a little difficult to sync the first time. I really have only used the Tap to play music and to ask for the weather. I like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen.
I have a few top end Bluetooth speakers and this Amazon tap rates right up with them in sound and built quality plus it has alexa built in
We now have one for everyone in the family and no longer share. I would have no problem recommending this to a friend.
Great product for intro to an AI device. Cant wait to upgrade to echo.
The more I use this, the more reasons I enjoy it. The staff were great and helped me set it up.
got as a gift. Might not have got for my self- but love it and glad I had a birthday - lol
I bought 1 of everything. Like this one the best. VERY good sound, grab it off the base and take it to another room or outside and enjoy the music.
Was excited to get this product for its sheer portability alone (doesn't need to be plugged into an electrical outlet all the time like we have to do with our Echo Dot), but was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and volume! We prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker, and its "Hands-Free" mode is a great updated feature (though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it does drain the battery faster)...
I have the Amazon dot, which is great. But after purchasing the tap, which was on sale too, I was sold. You can take it any where. And the sound is great!!!
I will rate this Amazon Tap a five stars when the application to make the Alexa commands become remote, instead of manually pressing the command button on the unit itself.
Already have a few other Alexas. Wanted on to be portable around the house without having to plug in or connect to another speaker. Works as expected.
Enjoying the product and feel the ease of use is good.
Just really thought it would have been more useful without having to have to make additional purchases for music I like.
Looking for a radio for the kitchen this works great the more you use it the smarter it gets
I love this product , so nice to have for trips!!!
Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to "tap" the speaker to get it to listen.
Pleased with all the features. Amazon did another fantastic job with bringing great sound inna small package.
If you want to listen to music you will have to sign for Amazon unlimited or Prime which is very expensive. Pandora does not work too well with this device as it does with Google Home.
Great concept but speaker not so good at full volume. And maybe better now with the updates
This item was very easy to use from the very beginning and was very responsive to my request and commands. I like the fact that you can also add other items to work with it
This is one of the coolest new inventions around. It is very innovative and works great. It's really neat asking Alexa to play different songs and telling it you are bored.
The Amazon Tap is a great addition to my Smarthome system. We particularly like that we can move it from room to room without AC attached & the battery lasts a long time. We even take it outside to listen to music from Amazon Prime and Spotify. We recommend it highly.
Best sounding Amazon speaker hands down. The only annoyance is that it beeps after the "Alexa" wake word and after the command, unlike the other echos I have with no obvious way to turn this off. Other than that, sounds great and can take with you pretty well anywhere....
I habe the echo and I bought this one fort my son's room but it's not as user friendly. I wish I would've just bought the other one.
Great value and quality speaker that also connects to the information highway.
I bought this as a gift for my father. He absolutely loves it!!
I ordered this and actually came in earlier than predicted and it works beautiful! I'm totally happy with my purchase!!!
This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family.
I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing.
We bought this Amazon Tap Bluetooth and wifi wireless speaker for my brother. He loves it! He can play his fave tunes by the pool and it really holds a charge for hours of wireless listening.
The echo is great for music, weather, and anything else you have integrated in the house.
Good product works amazing . Works awesome from home .
I couldn't decide on which one to buy. They all do the same things, but ended up buying the tap which is portable. I take it on my deck with a cup of coffee and listen to the music I put in through pandora and iheart radio. I absolutely love it, and so does my husband.
i got one for my mom she's 90 years young and she sits and listens to it all day, she;s got the amazon tap i got my draugther the dot and i got my self another tap. i just found out you can put the tap on hands free and you dont have to tap the button this made it even better. my grand kids love playing ganes with alexa. like i said every household need one
The latest software update included hands free mode. So this can do everything that the stationary Echo speaker does, but is fully portable. Personally, I don't want the device to record everything I say all the time, so I only use the tap mode. The sound quality is good for a speaker of this size. This is especially a great choice if you have a mobile hotspot with unlimited data. You can now bring Alexa on the go.
I was impressed with the sound of the original Echo, the price of the Dot. The Echo Tap is the best of both and Portable. I have echos in multiple rooms. I got this to bring music outside to the patio. The music has rich bass and clear sound perfect for tunes or talk. Now that SiriusXM is on Alexa too I have access to great music, Howard stern, NFL, MLB and all the rest of the satellite radio content. The great thing about the tap is unlike a normal Bluetooth speaker this one works solo with Alexa and wifi. Even my wife loves it I think she talks to Alexa now more than she talks to me.
Still in the learning process--looking forward to more benefits!
I like buying things that work as advertised. This does.Although it does not respond as well to my wife's commands. Hmmm...
This is a fun and convenient toy, but I'm surprised about some of the limitations. I keep hearing the same NPR news clip when I ask for news or headline news. I would like more news highlights. When I ask for 80s music, Echo starts with the same 1 of 3 songs each time.
I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few "I didn't understand that" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight.
This is so easy to operate and fun too! I love it!!
Thoughts of being able to have the Echo "grow" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement.
Love the fact that it has a rechargeable battery and can be moved with no issues for listening in other rooms. Has a decent amount of Bass for the size.
Awesome speaker easy to set up. Easy to play. Great by the pool
Same features as Echo now, but easier to move around the house as needed w/you.
Always loved the Amazon Echo. Now we can rake it with us, outside, wherever!
Smaller then what i expecting, alexa sounds loud and clear. Music sounds great, just make sure you enable alexa hands free so you dont have to hit the button
Reasonably priced and worth every penny! I love it.
I shopped for a long time until I found this and I am very pleased.
It exceeded my expectations and recommend this product to friends
The family really enjoys the Amazon Tap. This is an awesome investment. We talk to Alexa everyday.
Love having someone to take notes for me and play music on demand.
Chose this over a regular Bluetooth speaker and am so glad I did. Alexa really helps me be hands free and get things done. The sound quality is great. I've used it in the bathroom and no issues with steam.
Looked at the Echo before we bought this and I would have been a fool to buy it when you have to add a battery to make it portable. This has everything we need and then some.
It's amazing! I love how loud it plays the music!!
This product works great with my amazon account and best part is it does not listen too all my conversations. While it is an option I prefer to hit the button for it to recognize a voice command. That way its not listening till I tell it to unlike Google's device and the other amazon devices.
Love the Dot, Hate the Tap Portable! This device will not hold a charge for even one day. The dots are amazing though.
I just love this tap!! It is so much fun. The music is so great. I play the relation music every night,every night. Best thing ever!
Love the speaker and the assistance of Alexa. Was trying to choose between this and a regular Bluetooth speaker and this was a better choice for my needs.
Great speaker and the sound is great. Use it every day. Love being able to use Alexa when attached to my network.
The Amazon Tap is a perfect complement to our Amazon Echo. Put this in our office space...has all the advantages of the Echo and is also a great Bluetooth speaker. Having to "tap" the mic button to summon Alexa is no issue at all! Sound quality is as good as any Bluetooth speaker on the market and it's extremely portable.
Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.
I'm glad that I bought this product, it's easy to understand, my grandkids loves it.
Besides the missing app functionality (check compatibility before purchasing), it does exactly what I want it to.
Mostly just use it for the speaker. Still waiting on the no touch feature they are adding.
A friend gave me a Dot, which I enjoyed. I decided to explore the other devices. I was torn between the Echo and the Tap. After reading a CNET review, I chose the Tap because it is portable. My two frustrations are you cannot change the wake up word "Alexis", and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service. If you are Amazon prime or Audible book member, it is a great addition to you household.
Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker.
Great sound. Love it. It's value is well worth it.
This is the best of both worlds. A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device.
I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great.
Very happy with the Tap. We have the Echo and would have to unplug it and plug it in to use it on the deck. With the Tap we just take it off the charging stand and go. No more bothering with Bluetooth speakers and using our phone when we can just play music ever from the Internet with TAP.
It has a good sound. The battery last long and it connects easily to WiFi and blue tooth. But you have to touch a button before you speak to it.
This is a great on-the-go speaker. I like the fact that it sits on a charging cradle instead of having to plug in. Also, bonus: Alex. I like the update they have done to it as well where you don't have to push the button to activate her, you can just say her name. If you are looking for an echo with a decent speaker without paying too much, choose this one. Spend more,m and you can get the regular echo which has a better booming sound, but you can't travel with it.
we're early in the stages of home smartness but this is a good start
I like the product itself but its app is very slow esp. outside the U.S. when you are on the go.
Before I bought this I had a blue tooth speaker and an iPod touch. Both of which had to be charged and turned on etc. now I just tell Alexa to play music.
Love it, works better than anticipated. Also at a good price
We already had an Alexa but this one is a great addition. It's portable, rechargeable and good sound.
Its very nice and not as big as the echo. Didn't know there was a Tap available to buy.
Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she's pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions
This is the one to get after Amazon's update to have the device always on. It also has the best speaker of the three.
This product is ok, wasn't too impressed with the commercial was defiantly more interesting
Cute speaker. a bit expensive but the amazon streaming capabilities make it worth it
This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile.
I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.
A nice complement to the Alexa family. The sound quality is nearly as good as the original Echo, and the voice activation addition makes it an even better by, particularly for the price.
The echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you'll want them for all over your house.
This item is exactly what I was looking for. It is a perfect size for home or travel. It is very loud for its size.
Makes for a great alarm and reminder device. I own 2 dots and the tap. Use them all.
Great Bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of Alexa
Love being able to use Alexa unplugged. Amazing device!
Does as advertise. Good for bedroom and you can plug in external speakers.
It helps the kids with questions it plays any music you like .
Great sound quality from such a small item. Easy to hide so it's not noticeable.
For the price this Amazon is amazing. Just like the echo but smaller. I show everyone how great it is.
It is a quality product and has clear crisp sound. Best part it can be carried in any satchel. Sound is loud enough for a back yard gathering.
Definitely enjoy using this at home. I was surprised at how intuitive it is and was able to answer any question in seconds. I mostly use it to play music through Amazon player. I know there's tons more it can do and can't wait to take advantage of all its capabilities.
I first boughy alezxa from amazon and found the voice recognition and search algorithms lacking
I love this speaker it works wonderfully. Very recommend
Works just like echo but portable!! Great stuff. As described!
Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....
I love this product. Great sound quality and at a good price
I have the Amazon Tap (which I purchased at Best Buy about a month ago) and love it so much I bought one for my son and his family. They love it, too!
I wanted a speaker to listen to Pandora and go so much more! Being able to speak to Alexa and get news, weather, timer, light controls and so much more! Love the product!
I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where
Love Alexa. We currently have three devices that we use on a daily basis. I use one at work basically for streaming music. Great device. No problems connecting to any of them.
Smart, timely, very effective around the house. I have a Dot as well but the Tap has MUCH better sound. I had a Google Earth and replaced it with the TAP because Google was not as smart as Tappy!
It's very easy to connect devices, and it produces a good sound. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
I already own the Amazon Echo, so for smart speaker, it is one of the most handy devices out there. There is so many things you will find that you can do with it and the list keeps growing. Since the software update that allows you to use "Always On" voice commands like its big brother, it has become my go to device.Pros:- Wireless Bluetooth Smart Speaker - I take it to work and use it in the car, even when I travel for work- Sync's up with my popular music aps (Spotify, Pandora, etc)- Alexa is very responsive and can answer your questions quickly- The best Alarm Clock- I sync up with audio books and will use it on long car rides or business trips- Speaker is able to get loud- Control smart devices like lighting and my ecobee - Option to turn Off/On voice commands, can use tap button instead- Very long range for voice commandsCons:- Only single band Wi-Fi 2.4Ghz- Battery life when using "Always On" voice commands is short- Speaker quality is sub par for music compared to other Bluetooth speakersOverall the usefulness of this device is near perfect for my needs, with only minimal cons. I use this device pretty much every day and is small enough to make for an excellent travel companion.Tip for BESTBUY: You should carry cases for this device as I had to get my protector elsewhere
I like its flexibility, portability and it is the best value option of all three Alexas
Thank You. Great Product for all ages. Thank You!!
We got this for my son for xmas. He loves it. He uses it daily.
..exactly what I wanted, but the battery drains FAST when on hands free mode.
This Amazon tap is awesome! Take Alexa outside! The sound quality is amazing and the price is right!
My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.
This little speaker is way better that her mother. after that update making it hand free, i recommend to anyone.
It is a great addition to my home office. My Alexa is upstairs.
Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good.
Even as a speaker alone this item is worth the price!
Alexa {speaking from the Amazon Tap) is great to have around ! Current news, personal planning details as well as details that might have been forgotten are all available from Alexa..... The Tap sits next to my bed on the nite stand where I can easily call up ijnfo from my bed or as I walk by during the day or nite. Especially useful for a review of my calendar so I can review my upcoming days plans. Try Alexa in a store and my guess is you will want her at your house!
Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests. Nice device that will only improve with time.
I'm amazed the sound quality out of this little speaker unit set up is easy and I recommend it
you can ask alexa almost anything kids love it Plays all my music
We love that it is portable and can move from room to room effortlessly.
Great item, good service from Best Buy. It is uncanny that new and unique products are introduced often.
I bought this as a Christmas gift and it sounds amazing. And of course the integration is wonderful too.
Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment
I haven't figured it out yet. So far it seems ok but I haven't used all of its potential yet.
Overall sound is not as good as Echo, my primary source for Amazon content. However, the Tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock. It's portability sets it apart, however, it's nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting. Recent software update now allows listening mode. It does require a brief pause after saying Alexa wake word, but it does work. This drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button. The portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my Echo, which is fabulous!
Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size.
The product works well. However, you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device, Alexa. I really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome!!
The Amazon Tap has great sound and is responsive to requests for the songs and music I like. It has a rechargeable battery and is portable which is great for taking your music with you as you move around. Thumbs up for the Tap!
